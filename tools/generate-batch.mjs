 *
 * ONE GENERATOR, THREE BATCHES. The first two batches each had their own
 * near-identical script; a third would have made three copies of the same
 * compile step. The per-batch entry points are kept (`generate-reach-batch.mjs`,
 * `generate-federation-batch.mjs`) as thin shims so every command named in a
 * probe, a doc or a build log still works.
 *
 * The generated file is the REVIEWED artefact's shadow: the spec is what a
 * person reads and edits, the snapshot is what the app imports, and `--check`
 * fails on a single byte of drift between them.

 * Load a spec. Two paths, same source:

 *   2. fall back to the PRE-COMPILED bundle in `verify/specs/`, which ships with the
 *      offline pack, so the drift check runs in a tree with no node_modules at all.
 *
 * The fallback was added because a reviewer could not run the generators in the
 * uploaded archive (no esbuild). The drift CHECK was already available offline — the
 * batch probes build each batch from its spec and compare it to the snapshot — but the
 * command a maintainer reaches for was not. Now both work.
 *
 * The fallback NAMES ITSELF in the output: a verdict that came from a pre-compiled
 * bundle says so, and the bundle's sha256 is in verify/MANIFEST.json, so the reader can
 * see it is the spec that shipped rather than one recompiled on the spot.
