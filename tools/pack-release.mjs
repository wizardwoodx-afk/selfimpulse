 * pack-release.mjs — build the two artifacts a release needs, and say what each
 * one is for.
 *
 *   node tools/pack-release.mjs [--out <dir>]
 *
 * WHY TWO. The first 19.6 archive was an overlay: modules, probes and rebuilt
 * bundles, with no `tsconfig.json` and no `verify/run.mjs`. A reviewer who
 * unzipped it could not run the commands its own release note named. The
 * overlay is still the right thing for a maintainer who has the host checkout
 * and wants the delta; it is the WRONG thing to hand someone who wants to
 * verify the claim. So both ship, named for what they are:
 *
 *   · SI-<v>-<Name>-full.zip      the complete tree. `tsc`, `npm test` and
 *                                 `sh VERIFY.sh` all run from a clean unzip.
 *   · SI-<v>-<Name>-overlay.zip   only what changed, to drop over 19.5.6.
 *
 * Both exclude node_modules, .git and the scratch files a working tree gathers.
