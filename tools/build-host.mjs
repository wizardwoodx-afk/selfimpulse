 * Build the A2A host engine bundle (tools/vh-host-engine.mjs).
 *
 * Same discipline as the MCP router and the offline verification pack: one
 * committed, self-contained bundle that the launcher (tools/vh-host.mjs)
 * loads — no build step at runtime, only Node. `probe/a2aRuntime.test.ts`
 * rebuilds this bundle in a temp dir and byte-compares it against the shipped
 * one, so a stale bundle (source changed, engine not rebuilt) fails the gate
 * instead of silently shipping an unmounted or out-of-date listener.

// committed host engine therefore could not be rebuilt on this machine, and
// probe/a2aRuntime.test.ts correctly failed its gate on a stale bundle. This is
// the same defect that was fixed in tools/build-mcp.mjs.
