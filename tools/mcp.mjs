/**
 * SelfImpulse — MCP capability router, stdio transport (16.2.0).
 *
 *   node tools/mcp.mjs          (or: npm run mcp)
 *
 * Speaks MCP (JSON-RPC 2.0, newline-delimited) on stdin/stdout. Wire the
 * server into any MCP client (Claude Desktop, an agent harness, your own
 * tooling) with stdio transport.
 *
 * EVERY capability call is routed through the product's governed pipeline
 * (risk classification → human gate on risky calls → signed receipt per
 * completed call). This entry point is a transport, not a back door: the
 * engine's single governed executor (runSelfImpulseToolCall) is the only route
 * to the tools. Risky calls return pending with an approval id — approve
 * or deny through this server's own approve_action / deny_action tools,
 * then poll call_status.
 *
 * The engine ships as the committed bundle tools/mcp-engine.mjs (rebuild +
 * byte-pin with: npm run mcp:build — same discipline as the offline pack).
