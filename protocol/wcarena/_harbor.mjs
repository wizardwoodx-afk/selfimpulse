/**
 * wcarena/_harbor.mjs — the shared bootstrap for the wcarena harnesses.
 *
 * v0.10.6 (RULE 5) changed what "legitimate" means: a capability CLAIM is no
 * longer a licence, so delegable authority must be GIVEN — by the harbour root,
 * or by an identity the operator designated at boot (IMPULSE_AUTHORITIES). A harness
 * that attaches to somebody else's harbour cannot play the operator, and without
 * an operator its "legitimate path" would be unprovable — which would make every
 * refusal meaningless. So each harness now OWNS its harbour:
 *
 *   · a real harbour process in a temp data dir,
 *   · an operator identity generated here and named to the harbour at boot,
 *   · the harness plays that operator and hands authority out as GRANTS.
 *
 * Everything is real: real ECDSA envelopes, real policy engine, real ledger.
