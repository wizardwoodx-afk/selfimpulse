/**
 * v0.10.4 · GRANT-AUTHORITY MATRIX — the canonical verification harness.
 *
 * Proves BOTH directions of scope-bounded delegation:
 *   · legitimate delegation still works end-to-end, and
 *   · every amplification route is refused.
 *
 * v0.10.6 (RULE 5) re-based it on GIVEN authority: the harness starts its own
 * harbour, plays the operator (designated at boot), and hands the approver its
 * tokens as real grants — a self-declared capability is no longer a licence, so a
 * matrix whose "legitimate" side is a claim would now (correctly) refuse.
 *
 * Run it — one command, no setup:
 *   node protocol/wcarena/v104-authority-matrix.mjs
