/**
 * VH-19 — Captain synthesis (19.3.0 "Vanguard").
 *
 * 19.2.0 made each routed member execute for real. The review's remaining
 * capability gap: the Captain REPORTED on N outputs but never REASONED over
 * them — the reply was sections, not a result. This module closes that gap
 * without giving up the honesty contract:
 *
 *   member results
 *     → deterministic divergence pass (claim atoms each member backs vs.
 *       atoms only one member backs — surfaced, not hidden)
 *     → the Captain's OWN provider call, under the Captain's own prompt,
 *       comparing and reconciling the members' real outputs
 *     → one coherent domain result, sectioned evidence still attached
 *
 * Honesty rules, probe-pinned (probe/synthesis):
 *   • synthesis NEVER runs on unexecuted members — it consumes real results;
 *   • synthesis is its OWN call with its OWN token-ledger entry and its OWN
 *     digest — never a relabel of any member's answer;
 *   • when the synthesis call fails, the run keeps every member answer and
 *     says synthesis was attempted and failed — never a fake combination;
 *   • the divergence list is computed, not asserted: atoms single-sourced
 *     are labelled "single-sourced", never silently dropped or duplicated.
