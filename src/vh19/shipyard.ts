/**
 * VH-19 — The Shipyard (19.1.0 "Shipyard"): the Team workspace.
 *
 * One brief ("build me a Y app") becomes a BUILD with one work order per
 * needed domain. Each order names that domain's Captain and a concrete
 * instruction; orders execute one at a time through the real Generalist
 * pipeline (gate, routing, provider call all still apply), each Captain
 * supervising its slice of the build. A build is DONE only when every
 * order genuinely executed; a blocked order blocks the build, and
 * settling requires the whole ship. State is a local checkpoint and
 * statuses come only from real execution results — nothing is simulated.
