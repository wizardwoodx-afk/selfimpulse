/**
 * AGENTIC MoE v2 — DOMAIN POOLS AND THE CREW GATE (19.7.4 [Crew]).
 *
 * MoE v1 (moe.ts) answers "which ≤3 experts cover this request". The crew
 * law answers a bigger question: given ANY task, find the DOMAINS it lives
 * in, build the POOL of specialists from exactly those domains, and field
 * the best crew from that pool — up to 25 working in parallel.
 *
 *   1. DOMAIN SCAN — the request's own text (verbs, nouns, deliverables)
 *      is scored against every routed specialist. The set of categories
 *      that clear the bar IS the domain footprint; the pool is every
 *      routed specialist in those categories. Pool size is DYNAMIC by
 *      design: "build an app" may pool several hundred across frontend,
 *      backend, database, security, devops, design; "file the GST return"
 *      pools a much smaller finance/tax/legal set. The number follows the
 *      task — never the other way round.
 *
 *   2. CREW GATE — one more tier above v1's point/standard/complex:
 *      requests that are compound AND span three or more domains open the
 *      crew tier, k up to CREW_MAX (25). The k is still the FEWEST that
 *      fully covers the task: the sparse-activation law did not get
 *      looser, the ceiling got taller.
 *
 *   3. SPARSE SELECTION + RESERVES — selection is still greedy on marginal
 *      coverage (no redundant experts, every admit carries a why). What is
 *      new is the RESERVE BENCH: for every selected member the pool's
 *      next-best same-domain specialist is precomputed at selection time,
 *      so a failed member is replaced by the next expert in its domain in
 *      one step — the failover path never re-scores the world mid-run.
 *
 *   4. RESERVES CONSENT — the registered bench (catalogued, not yet
 *      routed) joins pools ONLY when the owner switches reserves on. The
 *      honest-fleet rule from the federation work is untouched: no surface
 *      routes into a bench the owner has not wired.
 *
 * probe/moeV2 pins all four.
