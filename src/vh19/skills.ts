  skill("design.premium-ui", "Premium Interface Craft",
    "Produces distinctive, production-grade interfaces. Use for any UI surface, component, page or app work.",
    `Procedure:
1. Establish the design stance before any layout: who is this for, what feeling should it carry, what is the ONE thing on screen.
2. Refuse the generic-AI look: no default purple gradients, no centered hero-plus-three-cards, no stock rounded-everything. Choose one deliberate visual idea and commit.
3. Build the hierarchy first with type and space (size, weight, spacing), colour last. If the layout works in greyscale, colour is seasoning — if it needs colour to make sense, the layout is broken.
4. Use a real spacing scale (4/8px rhythm) and one accent used sparingly; neutral surfaces do the work.
5. Design every state: empty, loading, error, overflow, first-run. A premium product is premium in its worst state.
Quality checklist before delivering: Does it look like it belongs to ONE product? Is the primary action unmistakable? Does every state exist? Would a designer defend each choice in one sentence?`),

  skill("design.typographic-hierarchy", "Typographic Hierarchy",
    "Type-led hierarchy and readable text. Use whenever text, titles, tables or reading order matter.",
    `Procedure:
1. Set no more than three type roles: display, body, meta. Everything maps to one of them.
2. Hierarchy by size AND weight AND colour together — one axis alone reads as a mistake.
3. Line length 60–75 characters; line height 1.4–1.6 for body, tighter for display.
4. Numerals in tables get tabular figures and right alignment.
Checklist: Can a stranger find the title, the action and the metadata in under two seconds? Is anything competing for "most important"?`),

  skill("design.color-and-contrast", "Colour & Contrast Systems",
    "Purposeful colour systems that stay accessible. Use for palettes, themes, status colours, dark mode.",
    `Procedure:
1. Every colour has a job: surface, content, accent, status. A colour without a job does not ship.
2. Status colours (success/warning/error) are never the only carrier of meaning — pair with icon or text.
3. Verify contrast: 4.5:1 body text, 3:1 large text and interactive boundaries.
4. Dark mode is a redesigned palette, not inverted values: desaturate accents, lift surfaces, never pure black on pure white.
Checklist: Does each colour survive greyscale printing? Is every text pairing contrast-checked, not eyeballed?`),

  skill("design.spatial-rhythm", "Spatial Rhythm & Layout",
    "Grid, density and spacing decisions. Use for layouts, dashboards, forms, dense data surfaces.",
    `Procedure:
1. Pick one grid (8px base) and one density posture; mixing densities on one screen reads as unfinished.
2. Related things close, unrelated things far — proximity IS the grouping signal; borders are the fallback, not the tool.
3. Whitespace is structure: margins between groups must exceed padding inside them, always.
4. Dense data gets alignment (left for text, right for numbers) and zebra or hairline separation, never heavy boxes.
Checklist: Squint test — do the groups read as groups? Is any spacing arbitrary (not on the scale)?`),

  skill("security.evidence-first-audit", "Evidence-First Security Audit",
    "Security review that produces defensible, cited findings. Use for any security review or audit task.",
    `Procedure:
1. Enumerate the trust boundaries first (inputs, identity, network, storage); findings live at boundaries.
2. Every finding cites: exact location, attacker precondition, impact, and a reproduction sketch.
3. Severity = exploitability × impact, stated honestly; no severity inflation, no "could be critical" hedging.
4. Each finding ships with a fix at the right layer and a regression test that would catch its return.
Checklist: Could the team fix every finding without asking a clarifying question? Is every severity justified by a stated precondition?`),

  skill("security.assume-breach", "Assume-Breach Design Review",
    "Designs for the compromised component. Use for architecture reviews, key handling, multi-tenant or agent systems.",
    `Procedure:
1. Ask which single component, if fully controlled by an attacker, does the least damage — then check that is the actual design.
2. Every secret answers: where it lives, who can read it, how it rotates, what exposure looks like.
3. Privileges are per-operation, not per-service; a component holds the minimum for the operation in flight.
4. Logs must reconstruct who did what with which authority — an incident without an audit trail is unfixable.
Checklist: Name the blast radius of each component's compromise. Is any component's compromise fatal? If yes, say so plainly.`),

  skill("code.reproduction-first", "Reproduction-First Engineering",
    "Diagnosis discipline for bugs and incidents. Use whenever something is broken and the cause is unknown.",
    `Procedure:
1. Reproduce deterministically before proposing any fix — no repro, no diagnosis, say so.
2. Bisect the failure surface (input, state, version, environment) one variable at a time.
3. State the causal chain: this input, through this path, produces this observed symptom.
4. The fix targets the cause, not the symptom, and ships with the reproduction as its regression test.
Checklist: Does the fix make the reproduction fail? Can you explain the bug in two sentences to a non-author?`),

  skill("code.reversible-change", "Reversible Change Discipline",
    "Keeps risky changes survivable. Use for migrations, refactors, dependency upgrades, infrastructure edits.",
    `Procedure:
1. Before the change: state the rollback path and test it, or state plainly that this step is irreversible and why it is still right.
2. Change in the smallest increment that produces a verifiable result; verify before the next increment.
3. Data outlives code: never destroy data a rollback would need.
4. Feature-flag anything user-visible so the change and the release are separate events.
Checklist: If this breaks at 3am, what is the exact rollback command? Has anyone run it?`),

  skill("testing.pyramid-balance", "Test Pyramid Balance",
    "Chooses the right test level for each risk. Use when designing or repairing a test strategy.",
    `Procedure:
1. Unit tests own logic branches; integration tests own boundaries; E2E owns money paths and login — nothing else.
2. Every test names the production failure it would catch; a test that cannot is deleted or rewritten.
3. Speed budget: the inner loop stays under a minute or it will be skipped, and a skipped suite is a dead suite.
4. Flaky tests are quarantined with an owner and a date, never retried into silence.
Checklist: What is the slowest tier's runtime? Does each tier catch something the tier below cannot?`),

  skill("testing.adversarial-data", "Adversarial Test Data",
    "Tests against hostile and edge inputs. Use for parsers, validators, APIs, anything processing input.",
    `Procedure:
1. Every input gets five adversaries: empty, oversized, wrong-type, boundary (0/-1/MAX), and injection-shaped.
2. Unicode adversarial set: RTL overrides, zero-width joiners, combining marks, emoji sequences.
3. Time adversarial set: epoch, leap second, DST transition, year 2038.
4. Failures must fail closed with a useful message — a stack trace shown to a user is a second bug.
Checklist: Did any adversary pass through unchanged? Is every rejection message actionable?`),

  skill("research.triangulation", "Source Triangulation",
    "Research with verifiable confidence levels. Use for any research, comparison or market question.",
    `Procedure:
1. Every load-bearing claim needs two independent sources or is labelled single-sourced.
2. Tier sources: primary > official docs > reputable secondary > community; state the tier when it matters.
3. Date every source; a 2023 benchmark in a 2026 decision is flagged, not hidden.
4. Disagreement between sources is reported as disagreement with both numbers — never averaged into a fake consensus.
Checklist: What is the weakest source a conclusion rests on? Would removing it change the answer? If yes, say the confidence drop.`),

  skill("writing.pyramid-first", "Pyramid-First Writing",
    "Decision-ready documents. Use for briefs, proposals, reports, anything a busy person must act on.",
    `Procedure:
1. Lead with the answer and its stakes in the first two sentences — the reader decides whether to read on.
2. Then the three supporting arguments, strongest first; evidence follows each claim it supports.
3. One idea per paragraph; the first sentence of each paragraph must survive skimming alone.
4. Recommendations are verbs with owners and dates, never "consider exploring".
Checklist: If the reader stops after paragraph one, do they have the decision? Is any sentence load-bearing but buried?`),

  skill("analysis.assumptions-visible", "Assumptions-Visible Analysis",
    "Analysis a decision-maker can stress-test. Use for forecasts, models, metrics work, business cases.",
    `Procedure:
1. List the assumptions where the reader sees them, before the results — a model hiding its inputs is a rumour.
2. Show the sensitivity: which assumption moves the answer most, and by how much.
3. Report uncertainty as a range with its basis; a point estimate without a range implies false precision.
4. Separate measured data from estimated data visually and verbally, always.
Checklist: Could a competent critic break the conclusion by changing one stated assumption? Do they know which one?`),

  skill("devops.blast-radius", "Blast-Radius Engineering",
    "Operations changes sized by their worst case. Use for deploys, infrastructure, incident response, capacity.",
    `Procedure:
1. State the blast radius before the change: who is affected if this fails completely.
2. Roll out in rings (canary → partial → full) with a stated abort signal per ring.
3. Every automated action has a rate limit and a kill switch a human can reach in one step.
4. Recovery is rehearsed, not hoped for: the restore path has been executed at least once.
Checklist: What is the worst ten minutes this change can cause? Is that acceptable to a named human?`),

  skill("data.lineage-trust", "Lineage-First Data Trust",
    "Data work where provenance is a first-class output. Use for pipelines, dashboards, datasets, migrations.",
    `Procedure:
1. Every number names its source table, its transform, and its freshness before anyone acts on it.
2. Transformations are reversible or dual-run: new logic runs beside old until the outputs reconcile.
3. Quality gates at ingestion (schema, volume, null-rate) fail the pipeline loudly — silent partial data poisons everything downstream.
4. Destructive operations keep a restore window; "we can recompute it" is only true if the recompute is tested.
Checklist: Can every displayed number be traced to source in two hops? Does any consumer trust data no gate protects?`),

  skill("review.risk-weighted", "Risk-Weighted Review",
    "Review effort proportional to consequence. Use for any code, design or plan review.",
    `Procedure:
1. Classify the change's blast radius first: reversible/cosmetic vs data-touching vs user-facing vs security — spend review effort accordingly.
2. High-risk changes get the adversarial pass: what input, ordering or failure makes this wrong?
3. Every blocking comment states the risk concretely — "this feels off" is not a review finding.
4. Approve with the residual risks named; an approval that hides its doubts is not an approval.
Checklist: Did the riskiest line get the most attention? Could you defend the approval to someone who found the bug later?`),

  /* ── 19.7.2.1 [Agent] domain packs — bound to the finance and silicon
     categories in CATEGORY_SKILLS below ── */

  skill("finance.reconcile-first", "Reconciliation Proof",
    "Ties every statement to a register and itemises every difference. Use for GST/TDS/bank/payment reconciliation and any matching work.",
    `Procedure:
1. Name the two (or more) registers being matched and the KEY fields (invoice number, date, party id, amount, period) before touching data.
2. Match exactly; near-matches are listed, never netted off. An unexplained difference is a finding, not noise.
3. Itemise every mismatch with its direction (missing / extra / value-mismatch / timing), its ageing and the party that owns the fix.
4. State the tolerance used and prove that the residual (matched + explained + open = total) closes to zero.
5. Date-stamp the source extracts; a reconciliation without source snapshots cannot be reproduced.
Quality checklist: does the residual close? Is every open item owned and aged? Could a stranger re-run it from the named extracts?`),

  skill("finance.statute-current", "Statute-Dated Compliance",
    "Cites the exact return, section and period, and flags where rules may have moved. Use for any tax/GST/statutory filing or advice.",
    `Procedure:
1. Lead with the citation: form/return, section or rule, the period, and the due date (with the late-fee consequence).
2. Separate what the statute says from what practice does; mark anything that depends on a notification or circular as "verify against the current notification".
3. State the taxpayer's own facts the conclusion rests on; change a fact, change the answer — say which facts drive it.
4. Compute with the rates and thresholds of the relevant period; never mix periods in one computation.
5. End with a filing checklist: data source, preparer check, approver, portal step, acknowledgement number to archive.
Checklist: citation present? period-pure arithmetic? verification flags where the law may have moved? acknowledgement path stated?`),

  skill("silicon.signoff-discipline", "Sign-off Discipline",
    "No stage passes on hope: closed means closed with the command, the corners and the waiver owner named. Use for STA/DRC/LVS/coverage/test sign-off.",
    `Procedure:
1. State the sign-off criterion in numbers (slack >= 0 across named corners; coverage >= target with the waiver list attached) before running anything.
2. Every "closed" claim carries the exact command/version and the results file it came from; a number without its command is a rumour.
3. Corners, modes and instances in scope are enumerated; out-of-scope items are listed as out-of-scope, never silently dropped.
4. A waiver needs an owner, a reason and an expiry; "temporary" waivers with no owner are treated as open.
5. Report the delta since the last sign-off: what changed, what re-ran, what the change could have broken and whether it did.
Checklist: criterion numeric? commands archived? corners enumerated? waivers owned? delta stated?`),

  skill("silicon.reproduce-first", "Reproduce-First Silicon Debug",
    "Minimise, vary one thing, then conclude. Use for simulation failures, post-silicon bring-up, ATE fails and yield excursions.",
    `Procedure:
1. Reproduce with the smallest vector/dataset; a failure that cannot be reproduced is a measurement problem first, a design problem second.
2. Scope clocks, resets, power rails and temperature explicitly; an unscooped variable is a confound.
3. Bisect by ONE variable at a time (vector, corner, voltage, lot, mask step); record the table as you go.
4. Separate electrical from logical: the same symptom can be timing, power or a genuine bug — name the evidence that discriminates.
5. Conclude with the narrowest reproducible condition and the next experiment that would falsify your leading theory.
Checklist: minimal repro? variables scooped? one-at-a-time bisection? discriminating evidence named? falsifier proposed?`),
