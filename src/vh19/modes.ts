/**
 * CREW MODES — the owner's throttle on crew autonomy (19.7.4 [Crew]).
 *
 * The crew can field up to 25 specialists at once. Power without a throttle
 * is a liability, so every crew session runs under exactly one of three
 * owner-owned modes — and the owner may switch modes WHILE the crew is
 * working. The switch is part of the ledger, never a silent mutation.
 *
 *   MANUAL             every act waits for the owner's approval.
 *   SEMI-AUTONOMOUS    safe-tier acts run free; risky/critical hit the gate.
 *   FULLY AUTONOMOUS   safe and risky acts run free inside the hard caps
 *                      (initiative limits + circuit breaker still law);
 *                      CRITICAL acts always gate — no mode overrides that.
 *
 * HOT-SWITCH CONTRACT (pinned by probe/modes):
 *   • switching mid-run never kills in-flight work — an act already admitted
 *     under the old mode finishes under the old mode's rules;
 *   • every act admitted AFTER the switch follows the new mode immediately;
 *   • the switch itself is recorded (from → to → at → why) and announced by
 *     the steward, not whispered;
 *   • setting the mode that is already set is an honest no-op, not an event.
 *
 * Mapping to the initiative ladder (levels 0–3 answer "when does work
 * START", modes answer "who approves it"): manual pins the initiative
 * level at 0; semi and full leave the owner's initiative level untouched.
 * The engine never raises either dial itself.
