/**
 * THE CREW — a working space where up to 25 specialists work as one team
 * under the owner's governance (19.7.4 [Crew]).
 *
 * The law of the whole module, in order:
 *
 *   1. SELECTION — scanDomains → crewGate → selectCrewV2 (moeV2.ts). The
 *      pool is dynamic, the ceiling is 25, every admit and prune carries a
 *      reason, and a per-member reserve bench is staged for failover.
 *
 *   2. GOVERNANCE — every member act is admitted under the session's MODE
 *      (modes.ts): manual gates everything, semi gates risky/critical,
 *      full gates only critical. A gated member is a prepared ask at the
 *      human gate — the owner approves or refuses; the crew never raises
 *      its own mode, and the owner may hot-switch modes mid-run. Acts
 *      already in flight finish under the mode that admitted them.
 *
 *   3. EXECUTION — members run concurrently, bounded at CONCURRENCY (= 25,
 *      the same law as the ceiling), each through the real member agent
 *      loop (agentLoop.ts) with its own BEW receipt: a member that cannot
 *      prove VERIFY cannot report done. No provider key, nothing executes —
 *      the refusal is the session's outcome, stated, not a crash.
 *
 *   4. FAILOVER — a failed member is replaced by its bench reserve (same
 *      domain, ranked at selection time) in one step; the steward names
 *      the swap. A domain with no reserve left escalates to the owner as
 *      the ask, with the work named. The crew-wide breaker (3 consecutive
 *      unresolved failures) cools the session down — visible, never silent.
 *
 *   5. PROOF — every member carries a digest; the session receipt is the
 *      digest over the ordered member receipts. The steward reports the
 *      working as it happens; LOTUS keeps the token bill honest.
