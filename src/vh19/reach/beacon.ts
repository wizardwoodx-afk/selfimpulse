/**
 * REACH · BEACON — the harbor light (additive to 19.5.6 "Reach").
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS NEXT TO THE FLEET BOARD. `src/mission/fleet.ts` answers
 * "what did each seat DO" from measured events. It is a record of the past.
 * Beacon answers the question a human asks when they walk back to the desk:
 * *what does the harbor look like right now, and is anything waiting on me?*
 *
 * Five facts, one state. Beacon derives a single state from a bounded window
 * of pulses — never from a flag someone set:
 *
 *   halted    something is stopped and needs a decision before it moves again
 *   human     work is parked at a human gate; the harbor is waiting on YOU
 *   waiting   a seat is blocked on a peer, a lock or an upstream run
 *   flickering  contention: several sources are pulsing at once in a short window
 *   steady    work is progressing normally
 *   dark      nothing has pulsed inside the liveness window
 *
 * HONESTY RULES (the same ones the rest of VH runs on):
 *   • Beacon reads pulses. It never invents one, and it never upgrades a
 *     `dark` harbor into a `steady` one because a UI would prefer that.
 *   • A command reaches the beacon only through `redactCommand`, so a pulse
 *     can be displayed in a room without leaking a token into the room.
 *   • `seenOf` names the sources it actually saw, so "who is lit" is auditable
 *     rather than a vibe.
 *
 * Module only: no network, no transports, no storage of its own. The window
 * is passed in and returned; time is always a parameter.
