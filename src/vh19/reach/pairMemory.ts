/**
 * REACH · PAIR MEMORY — what two harbors learned together, and what an
 * organisation learned alone.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS NEXT TO §20/§21 MEMORY. `src/mission/memory.ts` owns six
 * scopes (mission, team, agent, artifact, decision, failure) and
 * `src/mission/interAgentChannel.ts` owns the versioned cross-seat blackboard.
 * Both are real. Neither can answer the question the Agent Bridge creates:
 * *what does THIS pair of owners know, from receipts both sides signed?*
 * A pair fact that cannot name its joint receipt is a rumour, so the pair and
 * org scopes REQUIRE one.
 *
 * FOUR RULES, EACH PROBED:
 *   1. Pair identity is `pairKey()` from VouchMesh — the same key the mesh
 *      already uses for trust. There is no second notion of "a pair".
 *   2. `pair` and `org` entries must carry a 64-hex receipt digest. Without
 *      it the write is refused in words.
 *   3. Supersession is append-only. A newer entry names the entry it
 *      supersedes; the older one is never deleted, so `history()` and
 *      `asOf()` can always reconstruct what was believed at any instant.
 *   4. `cuts()` reports what it withheld. A memory that silently truncates is
 *      a memory that lies.
 *
 * No storage of its own: the log is passed in, so a probe, a mission or a
 * renderer can hold it and the same functions work everywhere.
