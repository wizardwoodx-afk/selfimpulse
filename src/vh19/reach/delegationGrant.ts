/**
 * REACH · DELEGATION GRANT — what a peer's agent is allowed to do on YOUR
 * machine, decided before it arrives and stated in words.
 *
 * WHERE THIS SITS. `src/mission/harborTeams.ts` already runs the cross-harbor
 * ladder with the human gate on both sides, and `src/mission/a2aBridge.ts`
 * already executes an accepted delegation for real and seals it. `src/vh19/
 * vouchMesh.ts` already keeps pair trust, and `src/mission/custody.ts` already
 * issues scoped authority envelopes. This module adds the one decision that
 * was missing between them: the *narrowing*. A delegation arrives naming what
 * it would like to do; the grant is the intersection of that ask with what
 * this harbor will ever lend a counterparty at that trust level — and every
 * capability withheld is withheld OUT LOUD, with a rule name.
 *
 * THREE RULES, EACH PROBED:
 *   1. TRUST IS READ, NEVER ASSERTED. The tier comes from VouchMesh's pair
 *      standing (`meshRuntime.standingFor` → the same ledger the mesh writes
 *      when joint receipts are co-signed). A caller cannot pass in a tier it
 *      likes; it passes in owners, and the standing is looked up.
 *   2. HUMAN-FIRST IS ENFORCED HERE, AT RUNTIME, BY DEFAULT. A capability
 *      that writes, executes, spends, ships or touches secrets is refused
 *      unless a human approval naming that exact capability is attached and
 *      still valid at `now`. Shipping a release and reading secrets are
 *      IRREVERSIBLE and stay human-first at every setting; the recoverable
 *      three are human-first under the default posture and only an explicit
 *      operator setting relaxes them. A caller cannot relax anything: it
 *      supplies approvals, not permissions.
 *   3. A GRANT IS AN ARTEFACT. It carries the pair key, the standing it was
 *      computed from, the refusals and a digest over all of it, so both sides
 *      can re-derive the same bytes and file it with the run's receipts.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous apart from the standing lookup, which is injected.
