/**
 * REACH · BATCH — the 200-specialist industry bench (GENERATED, 19.5.6)
 *
 * DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. Compiled from `batchSpec.ts`, which is the
 * reviewed artefact: forty *industry* domains × five stations of work
 * (assess / design / build / verify / sustain), each entry with its own capabilities, routing vocabulary,
 * honest risk tier and system prompt. Regenerate with:
 *
 *     node tools/generate-batch.mjs reach
 *
 * The batch's probe fails if this snapshot and the spec disagree.
 *
 * Census at generation time: 200 entries over 40 domains —
 * 120 safe / 40 risky / 40 critical,
 * stations 40/40/40/40/40.
 * Provenance: vh-19.5.6-reach-batch.
 *
 * Reported through `federation/fleet.ts`: established 1,850 + registered 640 = fleet 2,490, with the routed
 * number always printed first.
