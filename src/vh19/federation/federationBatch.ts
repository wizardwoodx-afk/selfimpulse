/**
 * FEDERATION · BATCH — the 210-specialist practice bench (GENERATED, 19.6.0)
 *
 * DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. Compiled from `federationSpec.ts`, which is the
 * reviewed artefact: forty-two *engineering, practice and professional* domains × five stations of work
 * (assess / design / build / verify / sustain), each entry with its own capabilities, routing vocabulary,
 * honest risk tier and system prompt. Regenerate with:
 *
 *     node tools/generate-batch.mjs federation
 *
 * The batch's probe fails if this snapshot and the spec disagree.
 *
 * Census at generation time: 210 entries over 42 domains —
 * 126 safe / 42 risky / 42 critical,
 * stations 42/42/42/42/42.
 * Provenance: vh-19.6-federation.
 *
 * Reported through `federation/fleet.ts`: established 1,850 + registered 640 = fleet 2,490, with the routed
 * number always printed first.
