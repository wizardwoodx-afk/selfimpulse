/**
 * FEDERATION · REGULATED ACTIVATION — a catalog entry is not regulatory authority.
 *
 * THE REVIEWER'S PRODUCT NOTE, TAKEN AS A DESIGN CONSTRAINT.
 *
 * The 19.6.2 bench added 230 registered specialists across domains where the
 * governing rule matters as much as the technique — avionics software, medical
 * software, occupational and process safety, structural and electrical
 * inspection, official statistics, courts, immigration, customs, public health.
 *
 * Those entries are REGISTERED, not routed: they carry specification, routing
 * vocabulary, an honest risk tier and doctrine, and they receive no work until
 * the owner wires them in. That was already the architecture. What was missing
 * was the second half of the sentence:
 *
 *     a catalog entry for a regulated domain is not a claim that this product,
 *     or the person running it, holds authority in that domain.
 *
 * So activation is not a boolean. A regulated specialist becomes routable in a
 * JURISDICTION and a CONTEXT, both named by a person, both recorded, and both
 * renewable. This module is the policy that says so — small on purpose: it holds
 * no capability, it routes nothing, and it changes no behaviour on its own. It
 * exists so the product cannot quietly acquire authority it was never given, and
 * so a reviewer can read the rule in one screen.
 *
 * WHERE ENFORCEMENT HAPPENS. `activationGaps()` returns what is still missing for
 * a request; a caller that wants to hold the line calls it before enabling
 * anything. Wiring it into the router is the owner's decision, exactly like
 * wiring the registered benches themselves — and `probe/fedFleet` fails if a
 * registered bench ever reaches the router silently.

/* ── BINDING ACTIVATION TO AN OWNER KEY ──────────────────────────────────────

   REVIEWER'S NOTE, ANSWERED HERE. `enabledBy` is a string. That is enough to say
   "priya enabled this bench" and NOT enough to say "the authenticated harbor
   owner identity represented by key X enabled this". While the bench is unrouted
   and this module holds no capability, that gap is contained. The moment anything
   is wired to it, the governance chain has to match the one the crossing plane
   already uses: a decision, signed by the owner's authority key, bound to the
   exact content it authorises, filed with the same sentences as an approval.

   So activation now has a signed form, and the binding covers precisely what the
   reviewer listed — enabledBy, the owner key, the activation digest, jurisdiction,
   context and renewBy — plus the domains, because a signature that does not cover
   the domain list could be re-aimed at another bench.

   `judgeActivation` remains the completeness check (no crypto, usable by a UI
   checklist). The signature sits on top of it, never instead of it. */
