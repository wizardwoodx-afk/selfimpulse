/**
 * FEDERATION · FLEET — one honest count (19.6.2).
 *
 * THE CLAIM THIS FILE EXISTS TO MAKE FALSIFIABLE.
 *
 *   "2,490 specialists" is a marketing sentence until someone can say which
 *   ones are wired and which ones are catalogued. So the fleet is reported in
 *   two numbers that are always both printed:
 *
 *       established   1,850   routed by the Generalist today (the 19.7.2.1 bench)
 *       registered      640   specified, catalogued, counted — not yet routed
 *       ────────────────────
 *       fleet         2,490
 *
 *   Registered, in turn, is four benches a reader can check separately:
 *
 *       reach batch (19.5.6)        200   40 industry domains × 5 stations
 *       federation batch (19.6.0)   210   42 practice domains × 5 stations
 *       regulated batch (19.6.2)    230   46 regulated-field domains × 5 stations
 *
 * `established` is not "better" and `registered` is not a euphemism for
 * "missing": every registered specialist carries capabilities, routing
 * vocabulary, an honest risk tier and a real system prompt, and
 * `probe/fedFleet.test.ts` asserts that entry by entry. What it does NOT carry
 * is a claim of runtime execution depth — and this module never makes one.
 *
 * Wiring is the owner's decision, and it is ONE spread:
 *
 *     // src/vh19/registry.ts
 *     import { FLEET_SPECIALISTS } from "./federation/fleet";
 *     export const SPECIALISTS: Specialist[] = [...existing, ...FLEET_SPECIALISTS];
 *
 * until then `routedFleet()` returns the established bench, so no surface can
 * accidentally route into a bench the owner has not switched on.
