/**
 * FEDERATION · BATCH SPEC — 42 domains × 5 stations, 210 specialists (19.6).
 *
 * This is the fourth bench and the second generated one. The 19.5.6-reach
 * batch covered forty *industry* domains; this batch covers forty-two
 * *engineering, practice and professional* domains — the work that shows up
 * when a fleet with hands is asked to build, harden, prove, publish and
 * govern rather than merely answer.
 *
 * It deliberately reuses the station vocabulary from `reach/batchSpec`
 * (assess / design / build / verify / sustain) instead of inventing a second
 * one: two fleets that describe work differently are two fleets that cannot be
 * routed together, and the whole point of this release is routing.
 *
 * Provenance for every entry: "vh-19.6-federation". The batch is reported
 * through `federation/fleet.ts`, which is what makes the public count honest:
 *
 *     SPECIALISTS (established)      1,850
 *   + reach batch (registered)         200
 *   + federation batch (registered)    210
 *   = fleet                            2,490   — 1,850 established, 640 registered
 *
 * "Registered" is not a demotion dressed as a promotion: an established
 * specialist is wired into the router; a registered one is fully specified,
 * routable when the owner wires it, and counted truthfully either way.
