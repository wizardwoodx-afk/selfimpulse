/**
 * FEDERATION · THE COMMON VIEW — one place to check, two independent stores.
 *
 * THE ASK THIS MODULE ANSWERS. "Put the storage in one common place, so it is
 * easy for both users to check." Taken literally that is a shared server, and it
 * is exactly the thing this architecture refuses: a common STORE is a common
 * TRUST ANCHOR. Whoever holds it can add a row, drop a row, or present a
 * different history to each side — and both parties would have to trust the
 * holder, which for two companies amounts to trusting each other's vendor. The
 * Federation plane exists because that trust does not exist yet.
 *
 * SO THIS MODULE BUILDS THE COMMON VIEW INSTEAD.
 *
 *   Both sides record the SAME joint row for a crossing — the envelope, the
 *   decision, the outcome digest and both receipts — into their OWN store. Each
 *   side then derives a ROOT over its own entries, independently, and the two
 *   roots are exchanged and compared:
 *
 *     roots equal   → a co-signed root record: both sides hold the same set, and
 *                     each proved it from its own store rather than asserting it
 *     roots differ  → `agreed: false`, and the FIRST divergence is named in
 *                     words, down to the crossing id — never averaged away and
 *                     never softened into "sync in progress"
 *
 * `pairLedgerView` is what both users open: the union of the two stores in time
 * order. A crossing only one side holds is MARKED (`initiator-only` /
 * `responder-only`); a crossing both hold with DIFFERENT records is flagged
 * (`disagrees`) and both copies are handed over rather than merged — because
 * merging two different records is how a disagreement gets lost.
 *
 * WHY A MIRROR IS STILL ALLOWED. A neutral third party (an auditor, an insurer)
 * may hold the agreed root. That mirror can prove the sides later diverged —
 * which is the service a neutral party should provide — and it can never assert
 * what is true: it holds one number, not the records, and either side can
 * re-derive its root without it.
 *
 * WHAT A MATCHING ROOT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT — in the record itself,
 * because this is the sentence that gets oversold:
 *
 *   ATTESTED      both sides hold the same set of records: each derived this
 *                 root from its own store, and the two roots agree
 *   NOT ATTESTED  that the recorded actions were wise or authorised — agreement
 *                 about what happened is not agreement about what should have
 *                 happened
 *
 * No dependencies beyond the harbor's own SHA-256: runtime-free, WebCrypto-free.
