/**
 * FEDERATION · IDENTITY — one identity system, not two.
 *
 * THE REVIEWER'S THIRD POINT. The alpha's `createHarborKeys()` kept a private
 * key inside a closure and never persisted it. That is a fine *module* security
 * model and a terrible *identity* model: a harbor whose signing key dies with
 * the tab cannot be a counterparty anyone can pin. The fix is not to invent a
 * key store inside the federation layer — it is to REUSE the durable authority
 * identity the harbor already has:
 *
 *     authorityOwnerIdentity()            (src/vh19/missionAuthority.ts)
 *        ├─ native   → Tauri IPC keystore (OS credential store)
 *        ├─ encrypted→ AES-256-GCM envelope under the owner passphrase
 *        └─ session  → honestly flagged `session`, never claimed durable
 *              ↓
 *     federationIdentity()                (this module — a THIN resolver)
 *              ↓
 *     anchor + sigil                      (what a counterparty pins)
 *
 * This module mints NOTHING. It resolves the same owner keypair that signs
 * mandates and hands back an anchor that carries a PROOF OF POSSESSION —
 * because an anchor that is merely a claimed public key proves nothing about
 * who holds the private half.
 *
 * THE FACE IS KEY-DERIVED (19.6.1). Which material the mark comes from was
 * ambiguous in 19.6.0 — the module seeded it from `harbor:<owner>`, so the same
 * owner with a new key kept the same face, while the docs said the mark was
 * derived from the identity. Both readings were defensible and they disagreed,
 * which is the defect. The decision, now the implementation:
 *
 *     the mark a counterparty pins is derived from the CANONICAL PUBLIC KEY.
 *
 * So key rotation produces a NEW mark, and the mark is bound to the same
 * material the proof is: `faceSeedForKey()` hashes the SPKI PEM, and the anchor
 * body carries both the PEM and the resulting fingerprint. A swapped key cannot
 * keep the old face — `verifyAnchor` re-derives the fingerprint FROM THE PEM,
 * so a mismatch is caught twice over: once by the derivation, once by the
 * self-signature that covers the fingerprint.
 *
 * Two kinds of mark exist in this product and they are labelled, not confused:
 *   • a KEY-DERIVED mark (`faceSeedForKey`) — a harbor identity: the identity
 *     of record IS the key. Used by anchors, peer lists and approvals.
 *   • a SUBJECT-DERIVED mark (`sigilOf("<kind>:<id>")`) — a run-derived subject
 *     with no key of its own: a crew member, a specialist, a seat. The identity
 *     of record is its id. The UI says "identity mark" for these and never
 *     implies a key stands behind it.
