/**
 * FEDERATION · APPROVAL — a human decision, signed, bound to ONE crossing.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS MODULE EXISTS TO CLOSE. In the 19.5.6-alpha Bridge, the
 * responder side of a first crossing inferred permission from history: it
 * called `hasCrossedBefore(pair)` and treated a prior `success` row in the
 * ledger as evidence that a human had approved the relationship. A ledger row
 * is a RECORD; an approval is a DECISION. The two are not interchangeable, and
 * a row that anyone can append is not a signature by the human who owns the
 * machine. The initiator side already had a real signed approval; the responder
 * side did not. This module gives both sides the same object.
 *
 * WHAT AN APPROVAL IS HERE — STATE IT PRECISELY:
 *
 *   human            named, non-empty, and never a role string — a NAME THE
 *                    SIGNER CLAIMS, not a separate credential
 *     ↓ named by
 *   signature        ECDSA P-256 by the harbor's OWNER AUTHORITY KEY — the same
 *                    key that signs mandates, held in the owner's keystore
 *     ↓ over
 *   body             bound to THIS pair, THIS side, THIS capability,
 *                    THIS crossing envelope digest, and THIS nonce
 *     ↓ which is
 *   single-use       consumed once; a replay is refused by name
 *
 * WHAT THAT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. This distinction is the difference
 * between an accurate release note and a misleading one, so it is stated here,
 * returned in every record, and pinned by probe:
 *
 *   PROVEN      the owner-controlled authority key of that harbor approved this
 *               crossing, and it named the human it was acting on behalf of.
 *               The approval cannot be re-aimed at another pair, side,
 *               capability, envelope or nonce, and it can be spent once.
 *
 *   NOT PROVEN  that the named human authenticated with a credential DISTINCT
 *               from the owner key. A name is a claim the key holder makes; it
 *               is recorded and it is accountable (a receipt shows which key
 *               signed and which name it used), but no second factor, device or
 *               human-held key stands behind it.
 *
 * So the honest sentence is "the owner's authority key approved, naming the
 * human who authorised it" — never "the human signed". `APPROVAL_ATTESTATION`
 * and `APPROVAL_NOT_ATTESTED` carry those two sentences so no caller has to
 * paraphrase, and `approvalRecord` puts both, plus the signing key's handle,
 * beside every filed decision.
 *
 * It reuses, deliberately:
 *   • the harbor's durable owner key (`authorityWeb.OwnerKeyPairWeb` — the same
 *     ECDSA P-256 key that signs mandates, resolved through the keystore in
 *     `ownerKeyStore.ts`) rather than minting an identity of its own;
 *   • the capability vocabulary from `reach/delegationGrant`, so an approval
 *     cannot name a capability the harbor has no policy for.
 *
 * Everything here is runtime-agnostic: WebCrypto only, no node builtins.
