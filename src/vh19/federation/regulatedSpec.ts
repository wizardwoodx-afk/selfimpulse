/**
 * FEDERATION · REGULATED BATCH SPEC — 46 domains × 5 stations, 230 specialists (19.6.2).
 *
 * This is the fifth bench and the third generated one. The first two widened
 * the fleet outward: `reach` took the *industrial* world, `federation` took the
 * *practice* of building. This batch takes the third kind of domain — the one
 * where **the governing rule matters as much as the technique**, and where an
 * agent that does not know the rule is not merely unhelpful but a liability:
 *
 *   · the CIVIC layer — courts, immigration, customs, benefits, statistics,
 *     public records, consultation, emergency communications
 *   · the CARE layer — public health, epidemiology, veterinary medicine, and
 *     the safety and inspection regimes that stand behind them
 *   · the PHYSICAL-SAFETY layer — occupational, fire, process and structural
 *     safety; certification, calibration and environmental testing
 *   · the PLANNING layer — urban, transport and accessible design; construction,
 *     facilities, building services and waste
 *   · the REGULATED-INDUSTRY layer — regulated software (avionics, medical,
 *     industrial control), grid and refinery operations, nuclear and mining
 *     adjacencies, assurance, actuarial and forensic work
 *
 * Forty-six domains rather than a round fifty: the list is what the taxonomy
 * actually needed, and a padded bench is the thing this release exists to
 * refuse. Distribution across the fourteen categories the fleet already uses:
 * three each, plus one extra in security, research, analysis and business.
 *
 * The compile step is shared (`batchKit.ts`), the stations are the same five
 * the other benches use, and every entry is derived — a spec cannot give one
 * station a nicer prompt or a softer risk tier than it carries.
 *
