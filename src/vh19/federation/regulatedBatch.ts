/**
 * FEDERATION · REGULATED BATCH — the 230-specialist regulated-field bench (GENERATED, 19.6.2)
 *
 * DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. Compiled from `regulatedSpec.ts`, which is the
 * reviewed artefact: forty-six *regulated-field* domains × five stations of work
 * (assess / design / build / verify / sustain), each entry with its own capabilities, routing vocabulary,
 * honest risk tier and system prompt. Regenerate with:
 *
 *     node tools/generate-batch.mjs regulated
 *
 * The batch's probe fails if this snapshot and the spec disagree.
 *
 * Census at generation time: 230 entries over 46 domains —
 * 138 safe / 46 risky / 46 critical,
 * stations 46/46/46/46/46.
 * Provenance: vh-19.6.2-regulated.
 *
 * Reported through `federation/fleet.ts`: established 1,850 + registered 640 = fleet 2,490, with the routed
 * number always printed first.
