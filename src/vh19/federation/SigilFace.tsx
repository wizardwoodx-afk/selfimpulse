/**
 * federation/SigilFace.tsx — the Face, on screen, and honest about what it is.
 *
 * A thin React shell over `sigil.ts` and `identity.ts`. It holds no design
 * decisions of its own: geometry, colour and state words all come from the
 * module, so a mark rendered here is byte-identical to the mark the same
 * identity renders anywhere else in the product.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF MARK, LABELLED NOT CONFUSED (19.6.1):
 *
 *   • `KeyFace`   — KEY-derived (`faceForKey`). The subject is a harbor
 *                   identity, whose identity of record IS its public key. The
 *                   mark changes when the key rotates, and the hover text says
 *                   so. This is the mark a peer's anchor attests to.
 *   • `SigilFace` — SUBJECT-derived (`sigilOf("<kind>:<id>")`). The subject is a
 *                   run-derived thing with no key of its own — a crew member, a
 *                   specialist, a seat. The hover text says it is an identity
 *                   string mark and never implies a key stands behind it.
 *
 * Both are RECOGNITION aids. Neither is a security identifier: the key, and the
 * signature it makes, are the proof. Every hover title in this file says that.
