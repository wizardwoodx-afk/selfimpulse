/**
 * THE INITIATIVE→ENGINE BRIDGE (19.7.3 [Agent] — the reviewer's integration fix).
 *
 * 19.7.2.2 had the right architecture with one production bug: the console's
 * heartbeat called askVH19() WITHOUT the normal execution deps, so the engine
 * always saw "no provider" and only ever planned. This module fixes it by
 * making the seam impossible to half-wire:
 *
 *   • `engineExecutor()` is THE production ActExecutor. The console builds it
 *     with the SAME dep set the normal chat send uses (provider, human gate,
 *     handoff recorder, evidence fetch, userId) — one factory, no copy-paste.
 *   • The integration probe builds it with a scripted provider and drives the
 *     REAL askVH19 → routing → Agentic MoE → member agent loop → receipts
 *     path — the exact code the product runs, not a mock of it.
 *
 * The verdict mapping lives here too, so "what the engine's outcome means to
 * the initiative loop" is defined once and pinned by probe:
 *   error / refused → failed (feeds the circuit breaker)
 *   gated-out       → blocked (surfaced for the human, never forced)
 *   executed        → done, or partial when the reply itself hedges
 *   planned-only    → partial (no provider ⇒ nothing executed — said plainly)
