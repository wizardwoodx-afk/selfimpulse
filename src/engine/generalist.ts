/**
 * MJ — the Captain (CEO) front door (askSelfImpulse19 keeps its symbol so the store and
 * probes stay wired; the user-facing role is Captain).
 *
 * The ONLY agent the user talks to. One request goes in; behind it: GuardRail
 * scan → the user's learned memory → the MoE router → (optional) the human
 * gate → a real provider execution or an honest non-execution → a
 * provenance-digested response. Peer work delegates through the injected
 * A2A seam; nothing here invents a second front door or bypasses a gate.
 *
 * The honesty contract, restated where it is enforced:
 *   • no provider key        → outcome "planned": routes and plans in words,
 *                              executed: false. Never a fabricated answer.
 *   • provider failure       → outcome "error" with the failure in words.
 *   • risky + gate denies    → outcome "gated-out"; nothing executed.
 *   • risky + no gate        → outcome "refused"; risky work without a human
 *                              gate does not run, ever.
 *   • injection detected     → outcome "refused" with the finding codes.
 *
 * 19.3.0 "Vanguard" — the execution layer becomes real:
 *   • members with a wired workspace run an ACT/ OBSERVE tool loop
 *     (agentLoop.ts) — every tool call gated and receipted;
 *   • multi-member runs end in the Captain's OWN synthesis call over the
 *     members' real answers (synthesis.ts), divergences surfaced, not hidden;
 *   • the live-data GuardRail FETCHES cited sources when an evidence fetch
 *     is wired — "verified" then means retrieval, and the verdict says so.
