/**
 * QUOTA-SAFE PERSISTENCE (19.7.13) — degradation you can read.
 *
 * The problem this exists for: VH's live stores write JSON into localStorage
 * through `setItem`, and localStorage is a ~5 MB PER-ORIGIN budget shared by
 * every key the app owns (the memory graph, checkpoints, prefs, ~30 engine
 * keys). When the budget runs out `setItem` throws `QuotaExceededError`. Before
 * this module, three live call sites answered that throw differently and all of
 * them badly:
 *
 *   • graph/checkpoints.ts  → `catch { /* memory copy already holds it *\/ }` —
 *     the write VANISHED. The user's named checkpoint was gone after reload and
 *     nothing said so.
 *   • graph/store.ts        → no guard at all: the throw escaped into the UI.
 *   • vh19/memoryGraph.ts   → `catch { /* quota — keep memory copy *\/ }` — the
 *     graph lived only for the session; on reload the whole memory was gone.
 *
 * Silent loss is the one failure VH refuses everywhere else, so it is refused
 * here too. `writeFirstThatFits` takes a LADDER: the caller declares what it is
 * willing to give up, in order, and the ladder is walked until a payload fits.
 * The chosen rung is reported — with the count of what was dropped — and a
 * notice lands in a durable ledger the UI can surface. If even the last rung
 * does not fit, the call REFUSES IN WORDS rather than pretending to save.
 *
 * Honesty rules, same as the rest of the stack:
 *   • a successful write at a degraded rung is a SUCCESS, reported as degraded;
 *   • a refusal is never a silent no-op;
 *   • no notice is ever invented for a write that went in whole.
 *
 * The storage is injectable so the probes (and Node, which has no localStorage)
 * drive the real functions rather than a double.
