/**
 * SelfImpulse — the SI shell.
 *
 * This is the application's chrome: a fixed left rail, a 52px top bar and the
 * main column. It is a RE-SKIN of the shell that shipped before it, not a
 * rewrite of behaviour. Concretely:
 *
 *   - it reads the SAME store (src/ui/store.ts) and calls the same actions
 *     (go, newMission, boot). No new state was invented for the redesign;
 *   - it renders the SAME nine screens, each still wrapped in its own
 *     ErrorBoundary, so a throw in one door still cannot blank the app;
 *   - the styling lives entirely in ./si.css, whose tokens are namespaced
 *     --si-* so they cannot collide with the legacy sheet (vh.css), which
 *     another stream owns and which still styles the screen interiors.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY
 * ---------------------
 * Four accessibility defects were fixed here. All four are structural rather
 * than cosmetic, so they are worth stating:
 *
 *   1. TOASTS WERE SILENT. src/panels/Toast.tsx renders a fixed container
 *      with no ARIA at all, so nothing a toast said was ever announced. That
 *      file is not owned by this stream, so the live region is supplied here
 *      as a wrapper — role="status" + aria-live="polite" around the mounted
 *      <Toasts />. The announcement therefore works without editing a file
 *      another agent owns, and it is polite rather than assertive: a toast is
 *      information, never an emergency.
 *   2. NO WAY TO SKIP THE RAIL. The rail holds nine controls, so a keyboard
 *      user had to tab through all of them to reach the work area. The first
 *      focusable element in the document is now a "Skip to content" link
 *      targeting #main-content, and the main region carries that id plus
 *      tabIndex={-1} so it can actually receive focus.
 *   3. THE ACTIVE DOOR WAS ONLY A COLOUR. The rail marks the current door
 *      with aria-current="page" (it had this before, and it is kept) and pairs
 *      the navy left rule with a surface fill and brighter ink, so the current
 *      door is never carried by colour alone. The nav is a labelled landmark.
 *   4. FOCUS WAS INVISIBLE IN PLACES. A visible 2px ring on every interactive
 *      element is defined once in si.css rather than per-component, so a
 *      control added to a door later inherits it for free.
