/**
 * Federation — the explicit A2A mounting surface.
 *
 * The reviewer's point was correct and it was about product concepts rather
 * than code: the app bundled an A2A host, reported `a2aHostPath` from `app_info`,
 * and then nothing ever read that field. The architecture was real but invisible,
 * so a user had to discover federation rather than be offered it.
 *
 * THE DECISION THIS SCREEN ENCODES: mounting is EXPLICIT, never automatic.
 *
 * The A2A host binds a TCP port and publishes a signed agent card describing
 * this machine. Starting one on app launch would mean the product opens a
 * listener nobody asked for — which is the opposite of what this product is for.
 * So the button says what it does, and the user decides. That is not a missing
 * feature; it is the governance posture applied to the app's own network
 * surface.
 *
 * The second decision: this screen reports the SUPERVISOR'S state, not a guess.
 * "Running" here means the OS has been asked and said the child is alive. An
 * earlier version of this file called a mount successful because a command
 * returned before its 20-second timeout killed the server it had just started —
 * a green light on a process that was already dead.

          </li>
          <li>
            The host verifies its own engine against a committed SHA-256 before it will listen; a stale or
            tampered bundle fails closed rather than starting.

            Every inbound delegation still passes the same gates as local work: the receiver ladder, the
