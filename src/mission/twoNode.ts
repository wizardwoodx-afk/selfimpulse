/**
 * VH 11.14.3 — THE TWO-MACHINE PROOF.
 *
 * The 11.14.2 review's final judgment: the next real step is not another
 * feature — it is this experiment. Employee A owns the data. Employee B
 * requests a capability. The relay (the future cloud control plane)
 * coordinates. A computes locally. Only the permitted, bounded result
 * crosses. The privacy budget and policy apply at A. The egress receipt
 * proves what crossed.
 *
 * This module is the protocol, run honestly inside one repo: the relay is a
 * DUMB PIPE that forwards typed wire messages and logs everything it sees —
 * so the probe can inspect exactly what the coordinator learned, and prove
 * it learned identity / request / authorization / receipt, and NEVER raw
 * rows. No cloud infrastructure is built here — that is deliberate and
 * stated: VH remains the endpoint runtime; the relay is a simulation of
 * the thin control plane a real deployment would add.
