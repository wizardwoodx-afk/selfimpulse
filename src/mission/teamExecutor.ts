/**
 * TEAM EXECUTOR — the part that actually runs.
 *
 * Everything else is planning: which seat does what, which flags to pass, which worktree to work in,
 * what the budget is. This module is where a real child process is spawned, real bytes come back, real
 * dollars are charged and real evidence is collected.
 *
 * THE THREE RULES THIS MODULE IS BUILT AROUND
 *
 * 1. NOTHING IS INFERRED THAT COULD BE MEASURED.
 *    Did the agent succeed? Run the repository's own check and look at the exit code. Did it change
 *    anything? Ask git. How much did it cost? Read the number out of the CLI's own output. When a
 *    measurement is not available, VH says "not measured" — it never substitutes an assumption.
 *
 * 2. CONTINUITY IS REAL OR IT IS DECLARED ABSENT.
 *    Each seat keeps a session. Turn 1 creates it, later turns resume it, and the id is captured from
 *    the CLI's own output rather than assumed.
 *
 * 3. A SEAT THAT COULD NOT RUN IS NOT A SEAT THAT PASSED.
 *    Missing binary, refused by the budget, killed by the deadline, nothing to review, or a check that
 *    never ran — each is a distinct outcome with its own reason, and each propagates into the merge
 *    plan. An unverified branch does not merge.
 *
 * THE REVIEW-VISIBILITY INVARIANT
 *
 * A read-only seat never runs against the base checkout while writers have uncommitted or unmerged
 * work. Before any read-only seat runs, VH builds a REVIEW SNAPSHOT — the base plus every writer
 * branch merged — and points the read-only worktrees at that. So a reviewer sees the work it was asked
 * to review, and the base branch stays pristine until a human decides to merge.
