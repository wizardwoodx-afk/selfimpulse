/**
 * §EVIDENCE PACK — one exportable bundle for auditors, compliance and diligence (VH 11.10.1).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * 11.9.9 built the evidence (receipts + vault), 11.10 built enforcement (the merge gate),
 * and 11.10.1 closes the loop with signature and execution. But enterprises and auditors do
 * not ask for features — they ask for a bundle. The Evidence Pack assembles everything VH
 * has on file into ONE JSON document with an explicit control mapping, so "show me the
 * evidence for your agent runs" has a single answer: this file.
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULE
 * The mapping to EU AI Act / ISO 42001 / SOC 2 is a CONVENIENCE CROSSWALK. It says which
 * controls VH's artifacts are relevant to; it does not say VH satisfies them — that is a
 * judgment the customer's own compliance process must make. The pack says so, in writing,
 * inside itself.
