/**
 * §40 TEAM SELF-EVOLUTION & FEEDBACK LOOP (V11.2).
 *
 * The Mission layer already evolves skills. Teams did not evolve at all: a seat's `instructions`
 * were written once, used forever, and every run re-measured the same mistakes.
 *
 * WHAT EVOLVES
 *   The only VH-authored text in a seat is its `instructions` (plus role/harness config). The
 *   harness binary's behaviour is the vendor's, not ours to mutate — so the loop evolves exactly
 *   one artifact per seat: the instruction text.
 *
 * THE LOOP
 *   run → measured signal per seat (did it run, did the repo's own check pass, what did it cost,
 *         what did the human rate it) → fold into per-seat stats → evidence accumulates →
 *   when the evidence is loud enough (≥2 failure/unverified/feedback signals across ≥3 runs and
 *   no candidate already pending) a rule-based candidate edit is produced (a SUPERSET edit:
 *   learned corrections appended, never a rewrite) → gates (size, growth, non-empty, superset
 *   preservation) → SUGGEST mode: human accepts; AUTONOMOUS mode: apply immediately.
 *
 * HONESTY RULES (the same ones the rest of VH obeys)
 *   1. A candidate's score is NEVER claimed before a run measured it. `candidateScore` stays
 *      null with the reason in `scoreNote`; the run after an application is what measures it.
 *   2. Simulated runs count toward the ledger's experience but never alone can justify a
 *      candidate — a fake agent that "fails" identically is not evidence, it is a fixture.
 *      (`minRealRuns` below.)
 *   3. Feedback is the human's signal, kept separate from measured facts: rating 1–2 is a
 *      signal with weight, a comment is quoted verbatim into the evidence, and a rating ≥4 is
 *      "do not change this seat" — it suppresses candidates for `suppressRunsAfterPraise` runs.
 *   4. Every decision is recorded: baseline text, candidate text, gate table, actor
 *      ("team-evolver" | "human:<name>"), decision, and timestamp. Nothing applies silently.
 *   5. OFF mode records but never proposes. SUGGEST proposes, never applies. AUTONOMOUS
 *      applies only what passes every gate — and even then the pre-apply text is preserved in
 *      the record, because an evolution you cannot roll back is not an evolution, it is drift.
