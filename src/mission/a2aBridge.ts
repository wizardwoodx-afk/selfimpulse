/**
 * §A2A LIVE BRIDGE — an inbound cross-selfimpulse delegation EXECUTES, and is sealed.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `selfimpulseTeams.ts` owns the cross-selfimpulse ladder: strict A2A
 * v1.0 discovery, JWS card verification, sender routing, GuardRail, the sender
 * human gate, a tamper-evident packet digest, the receiver re-scan, the receiver
 * human gate, and a digest both sides re-verify. All of that was real. The last
 * step was not: the receiver produced a completion STRING.
 *
 *     const artifact = `${toTeammate.name} completed: "${task}" — executed under …`
 *
 * A template literal that asserts execution it never performed, in a product
 * whose entire premise is that a claim without evidence is not a claim. That is
 * the one place the product could say "the agent did the work" without anything
 * behind it — exactly the failure mode SelfImpulse exists to make impossible.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD.
 *
 *     A2A packet
 *       ↓  (selfimpulseTeams: card verify · GuardRail · receiver gate · replay guard)
 *     runInboundDelegation()                       ← this module
 *       ↓  one seat, built from the receiving teammate
 *     executeTeam()                                ← the REAL executor
 *       ↓  real CLI spawn through the injected deps, real git, real verify
 *     buildProofReceipt() → verifyProofReceipt()   ← si-proof-receipt/2, sealed AND re-verified
 *       ↓
 *     { outcome, execution, receipt }              ← bound into the DelegationRecord
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT.
 *
 * This module has no fallback. If the host did not supply a harness, or the
 * harness's binary is not installed, it returns `ok: false` with the reason in
 * words and `outcome: "not-executed"`. It never returns a completion string for
 * work it did not run. A caller that wants a demo has to ask for the old
 * behaviour explicitly (`allowUnexecuted: true`) and gets a record whose status
 * says so on its face — the product's standard posture, not a silent default.
 *
 * The trust core is untouched: protocol v0.10.7, RULES 3–6, and every wcarena
 * harness are exactly as they were. This module sits ABOVE the ladder, at the
 * point where the ladder used to end.
