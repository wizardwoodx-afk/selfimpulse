/**
 * VH 11.13.0 — the Proof Dossier (differentiator: policy-to-proof, in one click).
 *
 * 2026 market research is unambiguous: coding agents compete on benchmarks and
 * inline UX, while enterprises say off-the-shelf copilots lack "reliability,
 * auditability and policy control", and governance vendors sell "policy-to-proof
 * management" as their headline. VH already holds every underlying artifact —
 * receipts, envelopes, the ledger, the measured experiment. The dossier packs
 * them into ONE exportable, digest-stamped file: what VH did, what it remembers,
 * what it believes, and the evidence that it improved — without VH running.
 *
 * Honesty rules, as everywhere in VH:
 *  - every number is read live from the local stores at export time — nothing
 *    is claimed that the stores do not hold;
 *  - the digest covers the payload exactly as exported; re-hashing the payload
 *    must reproduce it, so a tampered dossier fails its own check;
 *  - a store that is empty says so in the dossier ("none recorded"), it never
 *    inflates.
