/**
 * §A2A RUNTIME — the ONE bootstrap that mounts a selfimpulse on the A2A v1.0 wire.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Until 17.10.7 rev 3 the A2A stack was complete and
 * unreachable: `createA2AServer()` (transport), `makeDelegationHandler()`
 * (receiver ladder) and `runInboundDelegation()` (the LiveBridge) were all real
 * and all probed — but nothing in the shipped product called them. The only
 * callers were probe suites. A passing end-to-end harness proves the
 * architecture works *when a test wires it*; it does not prove the shipped
 * application exposes it by default. An external review said exactly that, and
 * the grep agreed: `createA2AServer` appeared in src/ once (its own definition)
 * and in comments.
 *
 * This is the mount. One function, the whole ladder, in the order the product
 * claims it runs:
 *
 *     load selfimpulse identity            → ECDSA P-256 keypair + fingerprint
 *     load the team this selfimpulse speaks for
 *     sign the A2A v1.0.0 card        → JWS over the canonical card bytes
 *     build the delegation handler    → receiver GuardRail + routing + gate
 *     attach the LiveBridge           → real TeamExecutor, real CLI, real git
 *     attach the receiver risk policy → the receiver re-classifies; a sender
 *                                       cannot downgrade its own risk class
 *     listen                          → GET /.well-known/agent-card.json, POST /
 *
 * Everything below is Node-only by construction: the browser app cannot listen
 * on a port, so the mount lives in the host runtime (`npm run host` →
 * tools/si-host.mjs) and in probes. The desktop face stays an A2A *client*
 * (discover → delegate → verify the returned receipt).
 *
 * HONESTY RULES, inherited from the bridge and restated here because this is
 * the door strangers walk through:
 *   • no execution deps, no harness binary, no bound repository → the runtime
 *     still mounts (it must, or it cannot refuse politely) but every delegation
 *     is REFUSED IN WORDS. There is no path from this file to a fabricated
 *     completion.
 *   • risky work is DENIED by default. A headless host has no human at the
 *     gate, and a gate that auto-approves for an absent operator is a door, not
 *     a gate. `riskyGate: "approve"` exists for a supervised host that wires a
 *     real `HumanGate`.
 *   • `seatMode: "drill"` (a deterministic local seat used when no agent CLI is
 *     installed) is reported in `describe()` and in every artifact it produces.
 *     It never claims to be a real model.

/**
 * A `BridgeConfig` whose CLI boundary is a deterministic local seat: a real
 * child process, a real worktree, a real git repo and the repository's OWN test
 * command as the verdict — but the "agent" is a script, not a model. This is
 * the drill's own idiom (the drill, `probe/a2aBridge` and the TeamsPage
 * simulation all use it) and it exists so the mount is testable on a host with
 * no agent CLI installed. It is never silent: every artifact it produces is
 * stamped `[drill-seat]`, and `describe()` reports it.
 *
 * `applyFix` decides whether the seat actually repairs the repository. Pass
 * false and the repo's test fails, the gate fails, and the record says
 * `executed-failed` — the anti-cheat path.
