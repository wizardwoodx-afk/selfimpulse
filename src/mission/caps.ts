/**
 * CAPS — the money, the clock and the turn counter, enforced before dispatch.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE
 *
 * A coding agent with no ceiling is a billing incident. Every orchestration layer that survives
 * contact with production has the same four controls: cost, turns, wall clock, and children. What
 * makes this one trustworthy is where the numbers come from.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE
 *
 * Cost is read out of the CLI's own output, or it is recorded as unknown. Never estimated. A token
 * count multiplied by a price VH guessed is a fabricated metric dressed up as accounting, and a
 * budget built on it is theatre. So `costUsd` stays `null` for CLIs that report tokens only, and the
 * ledger says so out loud instead of quietly charging zero.
 *
 * A second rule follows from the first: a zero token total is NOT reported as 0. Zero means "the CLI
 * told us nothing", which is different from "the CLI measured nothing". Conflating them would let a
 * failed invocation look like a free successful one.
