/**
 * AGENT SESSIONS — the thing that turns a sequence of CLI invocations into a conversation.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Every invocation of a coding CLI is a fresh process. A "reviewer" that has to re-read the whole
 * repository on every turn is not a team member, it is a search engine with opinions. Real teams need
 * continuity: the coder remembers what it wrote, the reviewer remembers what it objected to, and a
 * repair turn can say "fix the thing you just did".
 *
 * THE TWO RULES THE REAL BINARIES TAUGHT
 *
 * 1. Some CLIs let you choose the session id, some do not. Claude's `--session-id <uuid>` CREATES a
 *    conversation under the id you pass. OpenCode's `--session <id>` LOADS one and exits 1 with
 *    "Error: Session not found" if it does not exist — observed on the real 1.18.25 binary. Assuming
 *    every CLI accepts a chosen id breaks half of them on turn one.
 *
 * 2. Capture the id from the CLI's own output even when you chose it. That confirms the session
 *    actually started, which matters when the first turn died at authentication.
 *
 * Continuity was proven end to end, not assumed: turn one planted a codeword, a FRESH process resumed
 * on the captured id and recalled it exactly.
