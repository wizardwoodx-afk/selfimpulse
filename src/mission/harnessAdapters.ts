/**
 * §6 Agent runtime arbitration — the common runtime interface.
 *
 * An earlier version of this file held a table of argv templates and described
 * itself as "the source of truth for how to invoke each CLI". There are no
 * CLIs. External coding-agent CLIs were removed from 11Handle in 19.7.15, and
 * every agent now runs in-process on the owner's own provider key. What
 * survived is the part that was never about binaries:
 *
 *     AgentRuntime -> prepare / supports / invoke / parse
 *
 * Runtimes do not decide *which* one runs; `arbitration.ts` does that. Runtimes
 * contain no mission logic; they turn a task into a governed in-process call
 * and a structured outcome. The governance — authority, provenance, the human
 * gate — happens around the call, in `src/security/actionGraph.ts`; this layer
 * does not and must not decide authorization.
 *
 * `local-test` is an explicit, labelled test double. It exists so the mission
 * runtime, the flight recorder and the acceptance test can be exercised without
 * a provider key. It is reported as `simulated: true` everywhere it surfaces,
 * and `MissionRuntime` refuses to mark a mission COMPLETED on simulated results
 * unless the mission explicitly opts in. It never pretends to be a real runtime.
