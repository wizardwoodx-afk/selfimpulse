/**
 * §EVIDENCE SURFACES — the store-reading layer that turns VH's measured records into
 * the 14.0 evidence products (VH 14.0).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * 14.0's engines (finOps, assuranceScore, incidentDossier) are PURE: they take explicit
 * inputs so probes can pin their math. This module is the PRODUCT side of that contract:
 * it reads the stores the Mission Loop actually writes (vh.missionLoop.v1 cycle records,
 * the receipt vault, the human-feedback store) and feeds the engines from REAL measured
 * data. No page and no probe may hand synthetic numbers to the engines through this
 * layer — the numbers come from the cycle spine or not at all.
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULES
 *  - Derivation only: every input is computed from fields on the cycle record the loop
 *    wrote at run time (spentUsd, gate.tier, arena.gate, seat outcomes, tokens-only
 *    counts, the signed budget cap) — never re-estimated here.
 *  - Simulation is read from the record itself: a seat whose outcome starts with
 *    "simulated" ran in the labelled simulation (the loop's own definition,
 *    anySeatSimulated()) and is counted as simulated, never measured.
 *  - Egress violations are reported as 0 with a documented reason: VH's egress ledger is
 *    append-on-authorized — a refused departure never writes a record and never leaves.
 *    The refusal IS the gate working; there is no violation store to read.
 *  - Old cycle records written before 14.0 lack tokensOnlySeats/budgetUsd; the adapter
 *    treats them as 0/null (schema tolerance), which is the honest reading of a record
 *    that did not track them.
