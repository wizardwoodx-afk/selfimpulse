/**
 * Reputation-Weighted Multi-Agent Consensus Engine.
 *
 * In heterogeneous multi-agent systems, agents can disagree on code correctness,
 * security postures, or architectural contracts. A simple unweighted majority
 * can be swayed by hallucinating or low-context seats.
 *
 * This engine weights review votes by each agent's empirical historical reliability
 * (track record of passing verified checks, zero false alarms, and clean commits),
 * computes mathematical quorum thresholds, and executes automated arbitration
 * when deadlocks occur.
