/**
 * §ROLE BOARD — your harnesses, your roles (VH 11.9.9).
 *
 * THE REQUIREMENT THIS EXISTS FOR
 * VH used to ship teams with fixed vendor assignments: Claude plans, Codex reviews, Grok
 * synthesizes. That is a demo configuration, not a product — User 1 has a Claude Code
 * subscription and no Codex; User 2 has Grok Build and nothing else. Both are right. So the
 * role board flips the model: the USER declares which harnesses they actually have
 * (their subscriptions, their installed CLIs, their custom binaries) and the USER decides
 * which harness plays which role. VH never picks a vendor for them; it only warns when a
 * choice weakens the adversarial posture (see verifyGate.ts).
 *
 * HONESTY RULES
 *  - Assigning a harness the user has not declared as owned is an error, never a silent
 *    fallback — a team that runs a CLI the user does not have is a broken promise.
 *  - Assigning the SAME harness to write and to verify is allowed (it may be the only one
 *    the user owns) but is flagged: the Adversarial Verification Gate will then block runs
 *    in STRICT mode, because an author grading its own work is not a review.
 *  - "llm" (direct provider call) can never be a writer — it has no filesystem hands.
 *
 * Node-import-safe: localStorage is touched only behind guards, exactly like agentTeam.ts.
