/**
 * §33 Security boundaries.
 *
 * Mission-level permissions constrain everything an agent in that mission may do. The rule
 * enforced here: an agent inherits only what is explicitly granted, and a grant is always the
 * intersection of the mission boundary and the role's actual need.
 *
 * Path checks are conservative. When a path cannot be resolved to something inside an allowed
 * prefix, it is denied — not assumed safe.
