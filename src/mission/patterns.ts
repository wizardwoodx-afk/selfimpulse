/**
 * VH 11.13.1 — the Pattern Registry (adaptive extraction: patterns, NOT code).
 *
 * The idea, made honest: VH watches the agent ecosystem, notices that "Agent A
 * has the best sub-agent system" or "Agent B has the best tool calling", and
 * takes THAT CAPABILITY into its own skills — but only the pattern, never the
 * code. Copying code would entangle VH in other projects' licenses and dilute
 * the governance story that makes VH different; re-implementing a pattern
 * independently and measuring it through the same experiment + human-approval
 * pipeline as everything else keeps VH VH.
 *
 * Every entry carries provenance: where the pattern was observed, the license
 * of the observed project (reference only — nothing copied), and how VH adopts
 * it. `patternToSkillProposal` turns an entry into a normal skillEvolution
 * proposal: agents propose, HUMANS install (the ledger's RECOURSE rule).
 * Anthropic's commerce blueprint (Apache 2.0, Sept 2026) appears here as an
 * observed pattern too — including the stance VH answers differently
 * (single-agent skill loading vs VH's measured multi-seat teams).
