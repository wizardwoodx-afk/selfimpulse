/**
 * Mission replay: reconstructable state, not a transcript.
 *
 * `FlightRecorder.replay(seq)` already existed and already did the useful low-level thing — it hands
 * back the events up to a sequence number. What it cannot answer is *"what was true at that moment?"*,
 * because a list of events is a log, not a state. This module folds those events into a
 * `MissionProjection`: the agents that existed, which harness each was on, what had been spent, which
 * approvals were outstanding, and where the mission stood.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole point. A transcript tells you what was said; a projection tells you
 * what the mission was. With a projection you can scrub a timeline, diff two moments and get field-level
 * changes, and point at the exact sequence number where a decision was made — which is what makes
 * "why does this artifact exist" answerable in seconds rather than by reading a log.
 *
 * Honesty rule this module holds itself to: **a counterfactual never produces a result.** Asking "what
 * if a different harness had run this task?" yields a hypothetical selection plus an explicit statement
 * that the outcome is unknown. It would be trivial to synthesize a plausible outcome here, and doing so
 * would poison every decision made on the strength of it.
