/**
 * §AIBOM — the AI Bill of Materials auditors now ask for (VH 11.10.5, Verified AI Delivery V1).
 *
 * THE AUDITOR QUESTION (2026, per CISA/G7 minimum-element guidance and Codacy's auditor
 * survey): which AI tools/models touched the codebase, where, and are they approved?
 * VH is unusually well-placed to answer, because VH MEASURES this: every receipt records
 * seat outcomes with harness + identity digest. The AIBOM is that measurement, folded
 * into the inventory shape auditors expect.
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULES
 *  - version is "not measured" — CLIs do not report model versions to VH, and VH will
 *    not guess one. An honest unknown beats a confident invention in an audit document.
 *  - approvalStatus comes from the user's OWN Role Board declaration (the harnesses they
 *    said they own): owned → "approved", observed-but-not-declared → "not-declared".
 *    VH does not decide approval policy; it reports the declaration.
 *  - Only harnesses OBSERVED IN RECEIPTS appear. No speculation about tools that might
 *    be installed.
