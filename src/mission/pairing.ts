/**
 * PEER PAIRING — how a trusted machine gets a credential, without ever seeing
 * this machine's token.
 *
 * The problem this solves is real and was left open by a decision that was
 * itself correct. The A2A host mints a bearer token and enforces it on every
 * request. The desktop supervisor deliberately never returns that token to the
 * frontend, because a long-lived shared secret displayed in a UI is a secret
 * that ends up in screenshots, clipboard histories and shoulder-surfing. That
 * decision is right. It also meant there was no way at all to let a peer in:
 * the credential existed, and no honest route to it existed. Remote federation
 * was therefore impossible, and the screen claiming otherwise was overstating
 * the product.
 *
 * The answer is not "show the token". It is the shape every serious local
 * network product converged on: a one-time invitation that the operator reads
 * out, that the peer redeems once, and that mints a credential scoped to that
 * peer. The code the operator sees is a CAPABILITY TO OBTAIN a credential, not
 * a credential, and it is destroyed by being used, by expiring, or by too many
 * wrong guesses.
 *
 * The properties this file holds, and why each one is load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. SINGLE USE. An invitation is spent the moment it is redeemed. A code that
 *      leaked from a screen would be worth exactly one delegation round-trip.
 *   2. SHORT. An invitation expires in minutes, not hours. It is only needed
 *      while a human is standing in front of both machines.
 *   3. NOT THE TOKEN. The peer credential is fresh randomness, unrelated to the
 *      host token. Rotating the host token does not silently invalidate peers,
 *      and a peer token cannot be escalated into the host token.
 *   4. BOUND TO AN IDENTITY. A redeemed invitation records WHICH peer took it.
 *      "Somebody on the network used the code" is not an answer an auditor can
 *      accept, and this product does not ask people to accept one.
 *   5. BRUTE FORCE IS EXPENSIVE. A small alphabet read out loud is guessable in
 *      principle, so wrong attempts are counted and a handful destroys the
 *      invitation. A code that survives five wrong guesses is a code that can be
 *      guessed.
 *   6. NO SILENT DEFAULTS. A host with no invitation answers "not pairing" rather
 *      than minting one, and a redeem that cannot be checked says why.
