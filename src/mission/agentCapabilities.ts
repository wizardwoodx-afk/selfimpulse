/**
 * AGENT CAPABILITIES — what each coding CLI can actually be made to do, and how VH knows.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS DATA RATHER THAN CODE
 *
 * Nine CLIs, each with its own vocabulary for the same five ideas: take a prompt, emit JSON, refuse to
 * write, pick a model, resume a conversation. Hardcoding that as branches would scatter nine sets of
 * assumptions across the codebase. As a table, the assumptions are visible, comparable and testable —
 * and, crucially, each one carries the evidence behind it.
 *
 * THE LESSON THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND
 *
 * A doc-shaped capability table looks identical to a tested one until a real binary disagrees.
 * Twice in VH history a flag was shipped because documentation described it, and the shipped
 * executable did not have it at all. Both were found only by running the executable.
 *
 * The standing rule outlived every specific finding: state the evidence for each entry, and
 * keep the registry and the policy layer agreeing — probes pin that agreement.
 *
 * So every entry states its confidence and its source, and `enforcedReadOnly()` is keyed off
 * enforcement rather than off whether a flag merely exists.

 *   docs       — from the vendor's documentation. Usually right, occasionally ahead of the release.
 *   community  — from forum posts, issues and blog reports. Plausible, unconfirmed.
 *   unverified — VH is guessing, or the capability does not exist. Treat as a gap, not a feature.
