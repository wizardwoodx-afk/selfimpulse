/**
 * VH 11.12.2 — Custody: Authority Envelopes with hierarchical delegation.
 *
 * The external 11.12.0 review asked: receipts are signed, but WHO authorized
 * the mission, and how does authority flow to sub-agents? 11.12.1 added
 * attenuated seat envelopes; 11.12.2 makes the chain first-class and signed:
 *
 *   principal (a human, never an agent)
 *     → root envelope (the runner's click, scoped + expiring)
 *       → seat envelopes (strict subsets, delegation chain recorded)
 *
 * Rules, mechanically enforced by checkEnvelope:
 *   - the principal of every envelope traces to a human;
 *   - attenuation may only SHRINK scope (subset rule), never grow it;
 *   - a child envelope cannot outlive its parent;
 *   - expired or revoked envelopes refuse every action;
 *   - an action outside scope is architecturally unable to execute.
 *
 * Envelopes are signed (SHA-256 digest + Ed25519 where available) exactly like
 * receipts and packets, so the delegation chain survives an audit.

/**
 * 20.1 — the sealed-envelope brand.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE. `AuthorityEnvelope` is a plain interface, so
 * any object literal satisfies it structurally. `checkEnvelope()` read
 * `scope`, `revoked` and `expiresAt` and returned `ok:true` — WITHOUT ever
 * calling `verifyEnvelope()`, which sat ten lines below it recomputing exactly
 * the digest that proves those fields were not edited. `verifyEnvelope` had
 * zero production call sites (only a self-test in `arenaGate.ts`).
 *
 * So the exploit was trivial: hand-write `{ id, principal, scope: ["*"],
 * revoked: null, expiresAt: null, digest: "deadbeef" }` and every gate in the
 * product opened — `egress.ts:82` (data leaves the machine), `capability.ts:206`
 * (compute over the dataset), `teamExecutor.ts:470`, which then ATTENUATED the
 * forged parent at :481 to mint legitimate-looking per-seat envelopes for the
 * whole crew.
 *
 * WHY A BRAND AND NOT A DIGEST CHECK ALONE. `checkEnvelope` is synchronous and
 * is called on the hot path; `verifyEnvelope` is async because it verifies an
 * Ed25519 signature. Making the gate `async` would ripple through six call
 * sites. A digest check would still be forgeable by anyone who can recompute
 * SHA-256 over fields they chose — which is anyone, because the canonical form
 * is public. The brand closes the actual hole: an object that did not come
 * out of `seal()` cannot claim to have been sealed.
 *
 * The brand is a module-private WeakSet, NOT a property on the object. That
 * choice is deliberate and load-bearing:
 *   - a property would survive `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(e))`, so a persisted
 *     envelope reloaded from storage would lose it and start failing closed on
 *     a legitimate replay — a regression far worse than the bug;
 *   - a `Symbol` key would be dropped by any structured clone or spread;
 *   - a WeakSet is invisible to serialization, cheap to test, and cannot be
 *     forged from outside this module.
 *
 * The honest limit: an envelope that crosses a process or persistence boundary
 * comes back unbranded and is refused until `rehydrate()` runs, which verifies
 * the digest and the signature and re-brands it. That is recorded rather than
 * hidden — see `rehydrateEnvelope`.
