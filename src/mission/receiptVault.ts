/**
 * §RECEIPT VAULT — the Receipt & Compliance Center's ledger (VH 11.9.9).
 *
 * receipts.ts can ISSUE a proof receipt and VERIFY one with no VH state. The vault is the
 * layer between: the running record of every receipt VH has issued, kept locally, so the
 * Compliance Center can answer the enterprise question — "show me the evidence for the
 * last N agent runs, and prove it has not been touched" — without leaving the machine.
 *
 * What this is, precisely:
 *   - a local ledger (localStorage-backed, capped) of issued ProofReceipts + gate verdict
 *   - an auditor: audit() re-runs verifyProofReceipt over EVERY stored receipt, so a
 *     tampered local copy is detected by VH itself, not just by an external party
 *   - exporters: flat SIEM-ingestible JSONL, per-receipt JSONL (receiptToJsonl), and a
 *     compliance one-pager that states what VH does and — with equal care — what it does
 *     not claim (VH produces tamper-evident evidence; VH is not a certification body)
 *
 * Node-import-safe: storage is guarded, exactly like agentTeam.ts and receipts.ts.
