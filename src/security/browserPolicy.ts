/**
 * Browser network policy — the containment layer for an agent-driven browser.
 *
 * Source adoption. The security model (domain allowlist with wildcard
 * matching, network-behaviour controls, destructive-action gating, and output
 * caps) is adapted from agent-browser's documented security layer
 * (github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser, `docs/src/app/security/page.mdx`,
 * Apache-2.0, Copyright 2025 Vercel, Inc.) and re-expressed as SelfImpulse's own
 * policy module. No source file was copied and no runtime dependency was added;
 * this is first-party TypeScript implementing the adopted model.
 *
 * What was adopted, and what was deliberately not
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * ADOPTED — the policy model:
 *   - a domain allowlist with `*.example.com` wildcard support, where an empty
 *     list means "deny all", never "allow all"
 *   - per-scheme and per-URL checks that also constrain sub-resource loads, not
 *     just top-level navigation
 *   - an action policy that classifies destructive actions and can require
 *     explicit confirmation
 *   - an output-length cap, so a page cannot flood the context
 *
 * NOT ADOPTED — the runtime:
 *   agent-browser is a native Rust CLI whose allowlist REJECTS persistent
 *   profiles, pre-existing CDP sessions, auto-connect and state replay while
 *   the allowlist is active. SelfImpulse's browser is profile-based
 *   (`src/vh19/browserWorkspace.ts`), so adopting that runtime would have
 *   disabled the feature it is meant to protect. The plan (§3) says to take the
 *   security patterns, not the framework — this module is that outcome.
 *
 * The rule this module keeps
 * --------------------------
 * Policy decides. The browser does not. `evaluateNavigation` is a pure function
 * of (url, policy): it consults the policy and returns a decision. It never
 * consults the network, never mutates the policy, and never widens it. A caller
 * that ignores a `deny` has a bug, so every decision carries a reason string
 * that is meant to be surfaced and receipted.
