/**
 * SelfImpulse — the identity seam.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AN INTERFACE AND NOT A CONSTANT
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Until 19.8 the UI store carried `export const USER = "vh-owner"` and passed it
 * to every engine call as `userId`. That is fine for one person on one machine
 * and wrong the moment a second person appears, and the cost of changing it later
 * is not the constant — it is every call site that reads it.
 *
 * The product's direction is local-first now and a shared server later, so the
 * shape of the answer is fixed by the destination, not by today's deployment:
 *
 *   - `IdentityProvider` is the seam. It answers "who is acting, what may they
 *     do, and on whose behalf is this run recorded" and nothing else.
 *   - `LocalIdentityProvider` is today's implementation: one owner, resolved
 *     from the vault-backed owner record, with the full capability set.
 *   - A future `ServerIdentityProvider` implements the SAME interface — it
 *     verifies a session, resolves real users, and reports per-role
 *     capabilities. Nothing above this file changes when it arrives.
 *
 * What this module does NOT pretend
 * ---------------------------------
 * `LocalIdentityProvider` is not authentication. There is no password, no second
 * factor and no session token, because on a single-user desktop there is nobody
 * to authenticate against: the person at the keyboard already holds the machine
 * and the vault passphrase is the only secret in play. It says so in
 * `describe()`, and Settings renders that sentence rather than a green tick.
 *
 * What it DOES do, and what the compliance regimes actually need:
 *   - a STABLE subject id, so receipts and audit rows are attributable;
 *   - explicit CAPABILITIES, so a future role-restricted provider has something
 *     to narrow, and so "who may do this" is a fact rather than an assumption;
 *   - a DATA-HANDLING classification per subject, which is the input the HIPAA /
 *     GDPR surfaces need in order to decide what may be stored at all.
 *
 * The capability vocabulary is deliberately small. A long list of permissions
 * nobody checks is a list nobody maintains.

 *     may(capability) === identity lists it  AND  provider's policy allows it

 * explicit, reviewable statement of what this subject holds — and the provider's

 * `can()` is written carelessly (returning true for everything, which is the
 * easy mistake) can therefore never widen what the identity record grants.

 *   - no identity: the provider is not consulted at all. "Nobody is signed in"
 *     must not be a state in which a provider's opinion matters.
 *   - the provider throws: treated as a refusal.
