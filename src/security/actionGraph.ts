/**
 * §ACTION PROVENANCE GRAPH + CONTINUOUS AUTHORIZATION + TIERED HITL
 *
 * Built from four results this product's own review asked for, and from the
 * research they came out of:
 *
 *  - AGENTSAFE (arXiv 2512.03180) — an Action Provenance Graph linking prompts,
 *    plans, tool calls and outcomes, with CONTINUOUS RUNTIME AUTHORIZATION:
 *    authority is re-checked at each step, not once at the start, and a step
 *    whose scope has drifted escalates instead of proceeding.
 *  - 3PM (arXiv 2601.06223) — Transparency/Accountability/Trustworthiness via
 *    agent activity logging and DECISION JOURNALING: not just what was done, but
 *    what was decided at the fork, and on what grounds.
 *  - AIR (arXiv 2602.11749) — runtime incident-response guardrails attached to
 *    the loop BEFORE and AFTER each tool call, so a run that drifts is caught
 *    mid-flight rather than in review afterwards.
 *  - Tiered HITL — three distinct human moments, not one: pre-execution approval,
 *    in-execution intervention, post-execution audit.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A GRAPH AND NOT A LOG
 * A flat log says "these things happened". A graph says "this outcome was
 * produced by this tool call, which was authorized by this envelope, which was
 * derived from this prompt". The difference matters for the claim the product
 * actually makes: that an outcome is traceable to a decision. That is only
 * checkable if the links are hash-chained, and only useful if the chain can be
 * walked backwards from a receipt to the prompt that started it.
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULES (inherited from the rest of the codebase)
 *  - Nothing is recorded that did not happen. A refused step records the REFUSAL
 *    as the outcome; it does not record the effect the step would have had.
 *  - A node the graph cannot selfimpulse for is marked `unverified`, never dropped and
 *    never upgraded. A missing edge is reported as missing, not inferred.
 *  - Every authorization decision names the envelope it was measured against. A
 *    decision that cannot name one is not made.
