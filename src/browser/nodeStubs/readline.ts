/**
 * Browser stand-in for `node:readline` — v11.9.
 *
 * `acp.ts` uses `createInterface` to read an ACP agent's stdout line by line. There is no child
 * process in a WebView to read from, so there is nothing to line-buffer.
 *
 * Returns an interface that yields nothing and closes immediately, rather than throwing: readline is
 * always consumed as a stream, and a throw at construction would surface as an opaque startup
 * failure inside `acp_open`. An empty stream is the truthful answer — no lines will ever arrive —
 * and `acp.ts` already treats a stream that ends without output as a failed agent session.
