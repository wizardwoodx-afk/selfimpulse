/**
 * Browser stand-in for `node:os` — v11.9.
 *
 * Same story as `./fs.ts`: 11.8.1 installed `{}` via a silently-swallowing `require()` catch, so
 * `os.tmpdir()` threw an opaque `TypeError` deep inside sandbox probing.
 *
 * `tmpdir` is the one member `src/mission/sandbox.ts` uses, and it has no honest browser answer —
 * there is no temp directory to hand out, and inventing "/tmp" would be a fabricated path that a
 * later caller might try to write to. So it throws, naming itself, and the sandbox probe's own
 * guard classifies the environment as UNMEASURED (the honest verdict) rather than ENFORCED.
 *
 * `platform` and `arch` are safe to answer: they describe the WebView host, which is knowable.
