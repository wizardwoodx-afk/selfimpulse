/**
 * Browser stand-in for `node:fs` — v11.9.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A THROWING STUB AND NOT AN EMPTY OBJECT
 *
 * 11.8.1 shipped `require('fs')` inside a `try { } catch { }` that replaced the module with `{}`.
 * Two things went wrong, and they compound:
 *
 *   1. In an ESM bundle `require` is not in scope, so the `try` ALWAYS threw — in Node too. The
 *      probe suites silently tested a stub (`fsSync.mkdirSync is not a function`) and the gate
 *      went 38/40 without anyone noticing the runtime had been amputated.
 *   2. `{}` fails *quietly*. `collectAgentsContext` wraps its `statSync` in a catch whose comment
 *      says "no file here — that is the normal case", so a systematic failure and an empty
 *      workspace became indistinguishable. The app then planned a mission on missing ground truth and
 *      reported it as a clean result.
 *
 * The product's honesty rules forbid that. There is no filesystem in a WebView: the app does not bundle one and
 * will not pretend to. So every entry point here throws an error that names itself, and the
 * caller's own catch surfaces it as "AGENTS.md scan failed: …" — a visible reason instead of a
 * silent zero. The desktop build never sees this file; it gets the real `node:fs`, and the probe
 * suites exercise the real module.
 *
 * If a capability is genuinely needed in the WebView, the correct fix is a Tauri IPC command
 * (`fs_read` / `fs_write` / `fs_list` / `fs_mkdir` already exist), not a silent fallback here.
