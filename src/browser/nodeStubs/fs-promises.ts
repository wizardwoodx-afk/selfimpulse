/**
 * Browser stand-in for `node:fs/promises` — v11.9.
 *
 * `src/mission/checkRunner.ts` reaches for the async filesystem lazily:
 *
 *     const { readFile } = await import("node:fs/promises");
 *
 * which is the right instinct — it keeps the Node dependency out of the module graph until a check
 * actually runs. It did mean the 11.8.1 `require()`-in-a-catch fix could never have covered it, and
 * it means the Vite alias has to exist for this specifier too (an anchored one, or `node:fs/promises`
 * would be rewritten into `…/fs.ts/promises`).
 *
 * Every export REJECTS rather than throwing synchronously: callers `await` these, so a rejected
 * promise is what their own `try { } catch { }` is shaped to receive. A synchronous throw inside an
 * async function rejects too, but being explicit keeps the failure mode obvious when reading this.
 *
 * Same rule as `./fs.ts`: name the capability in the error, never return a plausible empty value.
