/**
 * Browser stand-in for `node:child_process` — v11.9.
 *
 * `sandbox.ts`, `checkRunner.ts` and `acp.ts` spawn real processes: the sandbox canaries, the
 * mission's own test commands, and ACP agents over stdio. None of that is possible in a WebView,
 * and none of it should be faked — a "successful" spawn that never ran would manufacture the exact
 * false success the product's rules exist to prevent.
 *
 * Before this stub existed, Vite externalized the module and the browser build threw
 * "Module 'node:child_process' has been externalized for browser compatibility" at call time —
 * accurate, but it names a bundler detail instead of the capability that is missing. These throw
 * the reason instead: no process can be spawned here, so say so.
 *
 * `spawnSync`/`execFileSync` reject or throw rather than returning a plausible `{ code: 0 }`.
 * A fabricated exit code 0 is how an unrun check becomes a passing check.
