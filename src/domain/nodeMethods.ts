/**
 * §V11.5 — NODE METHODS, THE HONEST CONTRACT.
 *
 * The owner's rule: node METHODS are IN-BUILT and NON-CHANGEABLE. A planner plans, a
 * coder codes, a critic attacks the plan — the user never edits the verb, only the noun:
 * what to operate on and where (URLs, paths, names, thresholds). This file is the single
 * place that says, for every node, WHAT ITS METHOD ACTUALLY IS — so the Inspector can
 * show it as a read-only contract line instead of a pretending-to-be-editable field.
 *
 * NODE_FIELDS carries the fold-fields: config keys that pre-date V11.5 ("fold: pre-existing")
 * versus the genuinely-new ones, each with a one-line default hint so the Inspector can
 * label every input honestly. composeAssignment() renders the whole assignment as text
 * (for Assist drafting and the method line) without inventing anything the user didn't set.
