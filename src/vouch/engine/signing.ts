/**
 * §ISSUER SIGNING — Ed25519 issuer identity for Vouch's proof receipts.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Receipts are tamper-EVIDENT (HMAC seal over a published secret) but not
 * issuer-authentic — anyone who knows the secret could have produced the seal.
 * The 2026 industry direction is unambiguous — Ed25519-signed, hash-chained
 * receipts with offline verification against a published key (IETF ACTA
 * signed-receipts, Nobulex, AgenticRail, Provenrail, agentmark) — so Vouch's
 * issuer is a cryptographic identity: a locally generated Ed25519 keypair
 * signs the receipt chain, and any auditor holding the exported public key
 * can verify Vouch issued it, with zero Vouch state. Same shared standard
 * ships: one verifier covers the current and the legacy wire formats.
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULES
 *  - The private key lives ONLY on the user's machine: sealed in the OS keychain on the
 *    native (Tauri) desktop, in webview localStorage on the browser edition, in-memory
 *    otherwise. It is never sent anywhere; this product has no server to send it to.
 *  - When the runtime has no Ed25519 (an older webview), the receipt is NOT faked:
 *    `signature` stays null and `signatureNote` says exactly what happened. The HMAC
 *    seal still applies, so the receipt stays tamper-evident — and says so.
 *  - Verification is the same algorithm everywhere: re-check the chain, re-check the
 *    seal, and — when a signature and public key are present — verify Ed25519 over the
 *    final chain hash.
 *
 * Node-import-safe: storage is guarded; crypto.subtle exists on Node ≥ 15 (global) and in
 * every modern webview, and Ed25519 in WebCrypto on Node ≥ 18 and current browsers.
