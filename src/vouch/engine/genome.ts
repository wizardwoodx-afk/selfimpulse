/**
 * VH-COLOR Phase 1 — the Capability Genome.
 *
 * The VH-COLOR protocol (open standard, v1.0) names its core unit the
 * "Capability Genome": a portable, versioned, signable description of one
 * evolved capability — what it improves, when it fires, how it runs, what it
 * may touch, where it came from, and where it stands in the lifecycle.
 *
 * This module is VH's engine-level implementation of the Phase 1 surface:
 *
 *   §11  Capability Genome shape            -> CapabilityGenome
 *   §31  21-stage lifecycle, state machine  -> GenomeStatus + GENOME_TRANSITIONS
 *   §41/42 promotion chain + hard gates     -> promote() / quarantine (G1-G4)
 *   §32-33 THE central invariant            -> the genome cannot carry its own
 *      "EVOLUTION MAY CHANGE CAPABILITY /    safety authority: the governor
 *       MAY NOT CONTROL ITS OWN SAFETY       grant is a SEPARATE argument to
 *       AUTHORITY"                           promote() (see G1), and the
 *                                            probe pins it.
 *   §40  signed capability package          -> buildCapabilityPackage / verify
 *   §70  trust grades C0-C5                 -> trustGrade()
 *   §45  auto-rollback                      -> monitor() (regression -> rollback)
 *   §46  evolution memory                   -> GenomeEvent history, append-only
 *   M4   bridge: existing VouchSkills are   -> genomeFromVouchSkill()
 *        the first genomes (lineage kept)
 *
 * Design rule for the phase: engine-level, test-pinned, ZERO new MCP surface
 * (the 20-tool conformance pin stays intact; a capability_* tool surface is
 * Phase 2, only after this engine is probe-locked).
