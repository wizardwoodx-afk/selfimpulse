/**
 * THE MERGE — 11Handle 16.0 (STEP3-MERGE-SPEC.md, milestone M1).
 *
 * The control plane governs; the execution core executes. This module is
 * the ONLY place the control plane reaches the execution core: the
 * `dispatch_mission` tool plugs into the real mission loop
 * (`runMissionLoopCycle`) here.
 *
 * One mission ID (`mission_xxxx`) is minted at dispatch and rides the job
 * end-to-end: every execution event is projected under it into the unified
 * receipt chain, and the mission outcome is recorded in the unified mission
 * ledger (one state — spec §2).
 *
 * Honesty contract: no fabricated results. Seats without a reachable CLI
 * agent report "blocked" (the execution core's own honest behavior); a missing crew is an
 * honest refusal; an engine error is an honest block. The receipt records
 * exactly what happened.
