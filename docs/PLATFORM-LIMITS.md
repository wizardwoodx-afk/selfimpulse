# SelfImpulse — Platform limits

Known environment-specific limits, documented so they are never mistaken for
regressions.

## Web (browser) edition

Agent execution and git operations require a host OS; on a static web host those
surfaces run the app's labelled `local-test` double. Every event, artifact and UI surface
it produces carries `simulated: true`, and a mission that used it finishes
`BLOCKED`, never `COMPLETED`. Signing, receipts, the vault, the gate and the merge
logic are the same real code in both editions.

### Storage budget, and what happens when it runs out

The browser edition persists to the origin store, which is a small fixed budget
shared by every key the app owns. Three live stores used to answer a full budget
by swallowing the error: the graph's named checkpoints, the editor preferences and
the conversation-memory graph each kept an in-memory copy and said nothing, so the
data read back as gone after a reload with no explanation. They now write through a
declared ladder — each rung names what it gives up, the smallest acceptable payload
is tried last, and the chosen rung is recorded in a notice ledger that Settings can
show. When even the smallest payload does not fit, the write **refuses in words**
rather than pretending. Recall is unaffected by a degraded transcript: every
conversation keeps its date, title and keywords.

Memory is also bounded by hard caps on nodes, edges and sessions. Pruning is counted
and reported — `graphStats()` returns the running totals — so a shrinking memory is
something the product says out loud instead of something a user notices later.

A single-file or OS-backed store on disk remains the intended next seat for the
desktop build; the browser edition is bounded by the origin budget by design, not by
oversight, and now states the bound wherever it bites.

## Windows

Four probe suites are environment-specific on Windows and are treated as such in CI
rather than failures:

- Linux sandbox wrappers cannot run on Windows.
- Windows filename rules differ (the wrapper-permission probes assume POSIX).
- Smoke tests need a real coding CLI binary on PATH.

All other suites pass identically; see `docs/history/VH-11.8.1-WINDOWS-CI.md` (archived engine record) for
the recorded run.

## This development environment

The release gates (tsc, probes, offline pack, vite build) run on Node 22 in this
environment; the Rust/Tauri shell compiles in CI and on any machine with a Rust
toolchain (`cargo check --all-targets`), not here.

## The security boundary (stated precisely)

The workspace root is **not** an OS sandbox merely because a command's `cwd` is inside it —
a permitted `node` or `python` process inherits the user's OS privileges and can reach
anything the user can. The meaningful boundary is:

```text
agent → policy/gate → contained executor
```

Every spawned process (shell, MCP, harness) runs through the containment ladder and the
run **reports the rung it actually achieved** — never inferred:

| rung | what it enforces |
|---|---|
| `unshare` | Linux user+mount namespace chroot: system prefixes read-only, only the workspace writable, `/tmp` a tmpfs, `HOME` redirected into the workspace |
| `bwrap` | the same policy under bubblewrap, when installed |
| `seatbelt` | macOS sandbox-exec: reads ok, writes only inside the workspace and scratch |
| `node-permission` | Node's own filesystem permission model, for node programs on hosts with no OS sandbox |
| `policy-only` | allow-list + workspace cwd + env scrub **only**, labelled as such — honest, not silent |

Adversarial probes (`probe/shellContain.test.ts`) run a live host-escape battery (node,
python, npm, git, cargo, MCP-style) against a planted secret outside the workspace and
prove it cannot be read or written. The policy layer (allow-listed programs, registered
workspace roots, env scrub) applies on every rung, including `policy-only`.
