# Implementation-gap document — 19.7.15

Engine audit against the frozen architecture. Written 2026-09-26.
Baseline and final state are both the full green gate. The runners print the
exact suite count; this file deliberately does not repeat one, and
`probe/docConsistency.test.ts` fails the build if a live document ever states a
count that disagrees with the tree.

This document is a record of what was found, what was changed, and what was
deliberately left alone. Items marked **OPEN** are real and are not done.

## 1. What the engine already satisfies

These were verified in code, not inferred from the docs, and were not touched.

| Frozen requirement | Where it lives | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| One runtime, role/capability profiles | `engine/agentLoop.ts` `runMemberAgent`; tiers are `Specialist` records in `types.ts`, not separate codebases | satisfied |
| Captain is the only human-facing agent | `captains.ts`; `face.tsx` | satisfied |
| Routing is sparse, capped | `moeV2.ts` `CREW_MAX = 25`, `POOL_CATEGORY_MIN = 3` | satisfied |
| AI proposes, deterministic code authorises | `tools.ts:371` refuses non-`safe` tools without a gate; `generalist.ts:284` tier gate | satisfied |
| Gate is a hard capability check, fail-closed | both above return `gated-out`, never auto-run | satisfied |
| Human gate is receipted on BOTH branches | `store.ts` `decideGate` writes `gateLog` on approve and refuse | satisfied |
| Receipts are hash-chained and tamper-evident | nested digests: tool → member → synthesis → provenance → ECDSA mandate | satisfied |
| Receipts are honest about what they prove | `types.ts:319` states the provenance digest is "an evidence hook, NOT a proof receipt" | satisfied |
| Federation is cross-principal | `federation/standing.ts` two-signature ECDSA standing grant, `reach/delegationGrant.ts` capability narrowing | satisfied, 2-party only |
| Regulated activation is cryptographically gated | `federation/regulatedPolicy.ts` refuses unsigned activation "a name is not an authorisation" | satisfied |
| Self-improvement cannot rewrite its own authority | `rsirals.ts` `GOVERNANCE_PLANE` frozen, `∂T/∂A = 0` | satisfied |
| Checker is never the author | external `verifier/si-verifier.mjs`, 10-check battery, digest-pinned, owner-countersigned | satisfied |
| Untrusted archives are scanned before decompression | `mission/archiveScan.ts` bomb defence + entry-name sanitising | satisfied |
| Quarantine exists for extraction | `mission/fileIngest.ts` | satisfied |

## 2. What was fixed in this pass

### 2.1 The tool layer was dead in production — **the largest defect found**

`store.ts` `runDeps` returned only `provider`, `gate`, `onHandoff` and
`evidenceFetch`. `generalist.ts:350` gates the tool context on
`deps.workspaceRoot`, so with that absent every member took the single-call
path. Consequences in the shipped app:

- `hasTools` was `false` for every member, on every surface
- all eight tools were probe-only: `fs.list`, `fs.read`, `fs.write`,
  `net.fetch`, `wiki.search`, `pc.exec`, `pc.browser`, `mcp.call`
- the per-tool risk gate never fired
- `ToolReceipt` was always empty, so the ledger showed runs with no tool
  evidence
- `attestMissionRun` returned `null` on every run, because `executedTools`
  was always empty

`engine/browserWorkspace.ts` already existed and was written for exactly this
seam. It was simply never wired. `runDeps` now supplies `workspaceRoot` and
`fsImpl` from a store-held workspace, defaulting to the in-memory backing and
offering a user-picked directory via `useRealFolder()` when the File System
Access API exists.

### 2.2 The human gate could clobber itself

The gate is a single slot in the store, and `makeGate` did
`set({ gate })` per ask with no queue. Two live asks meant the second
overwrote the first and the first promise never resolved — a run would hang
forever with a pending gate. Latent before this pass, reachable now that the
tool layer is live (a member can raise an output gate and a tool gate).
`makeGate` now chains asks so only one is pending at a time.

### 2.3 Members ran sequentially

`generalist.ts` ran members in a `for … await` loop. At `CREW_MAX = 25` and
`MAX_AGENT_STEPS = 5` that is up to **125 serial provider round-trips** for one
message. Members are independent — no member reads another's output — so they
now run through a bounded-concurrency map (`MEMBER_CONCURRENCY = 4`, a
rate-limit budget rather than a speed target). Result assembly stays in
routing order, so every digest and rendered section is byte-identical to the
sequential path. `crew.ts` carries a 25-lane implementation, but it is
unreachable from `store.ts`; this fix does not depend on it.

### 2.4 The provenance digest attested a route that never happened

`routeWithModel` set `routedBy: "llm-assisted"`, and `responseCanonical()`
commits to `routedBy` in the provenance digest. But the MoE floor then
replaced `routed.selected` wholesale, and the type's own doc says the field is
"which mechanism produced the final order". The digest was therefore attesting
an LLM decision that did not decide anything. The floor now sets
`routedBy: "deterministic"`; `fallbackReason` still records what the re-rank
did, honestly.

### 2.5 Seven hundred specialists had no tools

`toolsForCategory` covers 14 of 16 categories. `finance` and `silicon` fell
through to `default: return []`, so 700 bench members could be routed to,
gated for, and then do nothing. Both now map to
`["fs.read", "fs.write", "wiki.search"]` — read the source, write the
deliverable, consult a pinned reference. Deliberately **no `net.fetch`**, so
neither category can reach an arbitrary endpoint by naming one in a prompt.

### 2.6 Company and customer references removed

The finance demo named a real company, its real CEO, and its real
counterparties. Anonymised in place to `Synthetic Industrial Ltd`, and the
generator renamed `buildKrIndustriesLedger` → `buildDemoLedger`.

**The fixture's structure was preserved deliberately.** The six anchor rows —
a large purchase, a payroll run, an exact duplicate pair, a board-note
settlement, a negative credit note — are what `probe/financeExcel.test.ts`
asserts on. Renaming them without preserving the structure would have gutted
the test while leaving it green.

Left in place, with reasons:

| Kept | Why |
|---|---|
| `munshi/gstin.ts` "Tamil Nadu" | real GST state-code data; removing it breaks tax validation |
| `INR` and the GST challan line in the finance fixture | domain characteristics of the pack, not customer identity |
| `selfimpulse.ts` city knowledge base and the IST clock tool | a timezone feature, not a company reference — see OPEN-3 |

## 3. Design system

The palette moved from Charleston/champagne to the house colours:
Bistre ground, Feldgrau rail, Isabelline and Eburnean on light, Skobeloff
accent (lifted to `#2E9E9B` on dark for contrast). Three probes pinned the
old hex values; the pins were re-anchored to the new tokens **without
loosening what they assert** — not-flat-black, a real light ground/ink pair, a
single declared accent, the competitor-colour deny list, the font roles, and
the light-weight rule all still hold.

Corrections made to my own work after looking at a screenshot: the accent was
initially used as a large solid fill in three places, which made the rail the
loudest thing on screen. It is now a soft fill in the rail and a solid fill
only on the composer's send. The serif was removed from navigation, which had
been reading as a table of contents. The suggestion list lost numerals that
did not describe a sequence.

## 4. OPEN — not done

These are real. None is cosmetic.

**OPEN-1 · The self-improvement loop has no caller.** `selfEvolve.ts`,
`rsiralsV6.ts`, `canaryClient.ts` and `verifierTrust.ts` are 926 lines of
constitution, drift, canary and rollback governance. `runRsiCycle`,
`applyRsiDraft` and `settleRsiPromotion` have **no caller in `src/`**. Only
`recordRsiSignal` and `revertRsiMemory` are wired. The pinned external
verifier at `verifier/si-verifier.mjs` is never spawned by the app. The
machinery is correct and unreachable.

**OPEN-2 · `crew.ts` is dead (472 lines).** The only code with true
concurrency, per-member failover, a circuit breaker and hot mode switching.
No UI or `src/` caller. §2.3 works around this rather than through it.

**OPEN-3 · The clock tool is hard-wired to one city's timezone.** `selfimpulse.ts`
computes IST and `SelfImpulsePage.tsx` ships a starter button that asks for that
city's time. For a global product the clock should read the machine's own
zone. Left alone because generalising it touches timezone logic and three
probes, and it is a product decision rather than a defect.

**OPEN-4 · `gateRules.ts` is unwired.** `answerGateWithRules` is called only
by a probe.

**OPEN-5 · 27 modules are unreachable from `store.ts`.** Includes `byoa.ts`,
`wings.ts`, `graph3d.ts`, `modes.ts`, `steward.ts`, `lotus.ts`, `teams`
(`groups.ts`), and `finance/` entirely — so the finance engine, `xlsxLite` and
the demo generator ship in the bundle but run only under probes.

**OPEN-6 · `SELF_EVOLUTION_FLOOR` and `RSI_FLOOR` are decorative.** Both are
string arrays explicitly `void`-ed. Tighten-only is enforced *structurally* by
the override store's shape, which is the honest mechanism, but the named
"floor" is words. Either enforce it or delete it.

**OPEN-7 · `reach/delegationGrant.ts` is the weakest oracle.** It is the only
cross-principal decision point whose output is an unsigned hash, and
`bridge.ts` feeds its verdict straight into `crossFederation`. Everything else
in the trust fabric is ECDSA P-256.

**OPEN-8 · `selfimpulseMesh.ts` uses symmetric HMAC** inside an otherwise asymmetric
fabric (`attest` takes a shared `peerSecret`).

**OPEN-9 · `demoEntry.ts` writes files at import time.** Zero exports,
top-level `fs.writeFileSync`. Any future import of that module writes four
files into `demo/`. It should export a function and be called by the tool.

**OPEN-10 · 60 `DeskSpecialist` Lead/HR objects can never execute.** They
appear in `officeSnapshot` for display and are never routed to. The office
line prints `ORG_SPECIALIST_COUNT` next to the floor count, which reads as 60
runnable agents.

**OPEN-11 · `registry.ts` is 2,093 lines / 211 KB of inline data** loaded
eagerly into the module graph, plus ~9,000 lines of generated batch snapshots
in three more files.

**OPEN-12 · Every source change requires `node tools/rebuild-pack.mjs`
(~97 s)** or `offlinePack.test.ts` fails on drift. Correct behaviour, high
friction. Worth a `npm run verify` that does both.

**OPEN-13 · `routeWithModel`'s LLM call is still made and largely discarded.**
Its ordering is undone by `selectCrew`'s score sort, but it *truncates the
candidate pool to `MAX_K = 3`*, which is a real effect on routing. Removing it
would change routing outcomes and needs its own probe cycle, so it was left
in place. The attribution bug in §2.4 is fixed; the wasted call is not.

## 5. Standing instruction

Read and understand the implementation before changing it. Preserve components
that already satisfy the invariants. Change only what materially violates
them. Do not rebuild working infrastructure to match a diagram. Produce a gap
document before destructive changes.

**This document is that gap document. Items §1 and §2 are done and verified.
Items §4 are not done and are not to be reported as done.**
