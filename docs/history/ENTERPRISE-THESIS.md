# Enterprise Thesis — The Cloud Coordinates. The Data Stays Home.

*VH platform direction, 2026. This document is the validation artifact: what we
believe, why now, what we have already proven, and what must be validated
before heavy infrastructure is built.*

## One line

**A cloud control plane for companies whose data lives across thousands of
employee devices — employees collaborate and run approved operations across
one another's data without centralizing anything into the cloud.**

Shorter: **the cloud coordinates the company; the data stays with the people
who own it.**

## The problem, as companies feel it today

Corporate data no longer lives in one warehouse. It lives on laptops —
distributed employees, different locations, different networks — and every
current collaboration model forces a bad trade:

- **Upload everything** (cloud warehouse / SaaS storage): centralized breach
  surface, sovereignty and residency violations, and a direct collision with
  GDPR Article 25 *data minimization* — you copied data you never needed to.
- **Don't collaborate**: employees email attachments, use personal tools,
  and the shadow-data problem grows.
- **Clean rooms** (AWS/Snowflake/Databricks/InfoSum/Decentriq): real and
  funded, but shaped for *org-to-org analytics over warehouses* — not for
  Employee 1 needing one file from Employee 2's laptop.

The mental model everyone already understands — tightened: this is not
"WhatsApp for enterprise files." It is **WhatsApp's selective-sharing model
applied to enterprise computation**: you don't expose the whole gallery just
to send one photo, and a colleague doesn't get the whole dataset just to
receive one approved answer from it.

## The idea

**Control plane / data plane separation** — the pattern Tailscale proved at
network level and NIST Zero Trust prescribes for access — applied to
corporate collaboration over endpoint-resident data:

```text
                    CLOUD CONTROL PLANE
        Identity | Policy | Discovery | Routing
        Sessions | Permissions | Audit receipts
                         |
          -------------------------------------
          |                                   |
     Employee 1                          Employee 2
      laptop                                laptop
   Company data                          Company data
   Local compute                         Local compute
          \                                   /
           \________ encrypted channel ______/
```

The cloud knows **who, which device, which resource, what operation, whether
it was allowed, when, and what evidence was produced.** It never becomes the
warehouse.

### The upgrade that makes it a company: capability, not data

The stronger form is not "share a file." It is:

> **Expose a capability without exposing the underlying data.**

Employee 2 does not ask for `revenue.xlsx`. Employee 2 asks:
*"run the approved 'revenue by region' calculation on your data."* The
computation happens **where the data lives**; only the permitted result
crosses the boundary — with a receipt.

## What is NOT novel — and what is ours

Honesty first: "data stays on the device while the cloud coordinates" is an
established pattern, and adjacent products exist:

- **Tailscale** — cloud control plane, endpoint data plane (network level).
- **Aranya** — decentralized zero-trust access with endpoint-resident policy.
- **Volt4** — peer-to-peer fabric for files, structured data, analytics and
  commands with policy-controlled access.
- **Duality / InfoSum / Aggregion** — compute over data without moving raw
  rows (org-to-org, warehouse-shaped).
- **Olympus** — AI against data where it already lives.

So "data stays at endpoints" cannot be the moat, and this thesis does not
claim it is. The claim is the COMBINATION nobody ships together:

> **capability-over-data requests + endpoint policy enforcement +
> cryptographic receipts for every crossing + an agent runtime that can
> perform the approved operation under budget authority.**

Each piece exists somewhere; the enforced, audited, agent-executed
*combination* on employee endpoints is the bet.

## The hardest problem, faced honestly: aggregates can leak

Aggregate-only is necessary, not sufficient: narrow or repeated aggregate
queries can reconstruct rows ("average salary of the 3 people in legal").
The production system must eventually carry: dataset- and field-level
policy, minimum cohort sizes, query rate limits, result bounding, privacy
budgets, and differential-privacy-grade protection for sensitive classes.

The seed enforces the first five mechanically, today:

- **VH 11.14.2 — the Privacy Guard:** field policy, minimum cohort, hard
  per-window query budget, bounded precision — each refusal in words, each
  pinned by probe.
- **VH 11.14.3 — the two weaknesses the review named, closed:**
  (1) the query budget is now DURABLE — an append-only, digest-chained,
  anchor-sealed ledger scoped to dataset + requester + window, re-read on
  every request. Restarting the endpoint resets nothing; doctoring the
  ledger refuses everything. (2) capability requests now take filters, and
  the minimum-cohort guard applies to the FILTERED subset — "average salary
  for APAC" is refused at cohort 2 even though the whole dataset passes.

Still honest about what remains: production needs write-locking and real
tenant partitioning around that ledger, and differential-privacy-grade
protection for sensitive classes. DP is the enterprise tier, not the MVP.

## Honest engineering choice: three models

1. **Data transfer** — laptop → cloud processes it. The cloud sees the data.
   *(the model we reject)*
2. **Endpoint processing** — the laptop computes; only the result travels.
   The cloud never sees underlying data. *(our model, now)*
3. **Privacy-preserving remote computation** — confidential computing / MPC /
   homomorphic encryption. *(a later enterprise tier, not the MVP)*

Model 2 is the defensible start: it requires no new physics, works with any
data shape, and its claims are auditable with ordinary tooling.

## The moat candidate: zero trust you can *audit*, not just enforce

Meshes connect devices. Zero-trust systems make policy decisions. Almost
nobody produces **signed, verifiable evidence of every operation that crossed
a boundary** — who asked, what was permitted, what exactly left, attested
cryptographically, recomputable by an auditor who does not trust us.

That evidence layer is the differentiator, and it is the part we have already
built and probe-pinned inside VH:

| Platform requirement | Already proven in VH |
|---|---|
| Human authority for any departure | Authority Envelope: human-only principals, scope, expiry, revocation (custody, 31 probe assertions) |
| Spend/egress limits that hold under concurrency | BudgetGate atomic reservations; Egress Gate + digest-chained receipt ledger (66 live suites) |
| "Rules enforced in code, not prompts" | Guardrail Manifest — twelve pinned code checks |
| Proof-of-work export | Proof Dossier: digest-stamped evidence file |
| Agents can propose, only humans install | Ledger write-permission matrix |

VH is the **flagship endpoint workload** of this platform: the runtime that
demonstrates the platform's guarantees on a single machine, before any cloud
exists.

## The two-machine proof — run (VH 11.14.3)

The 11.14.2 review said the next real step was not another feature but this
experiment: A owns the data, B requests a capability, the relay coordinates,
A computes locally, only the permitted result crosses, policy and budget
apply, the receipt proves what crossed. It ran — as an honest in-repo
protocol simulation (`src/mission/twoNode.ts`, probe-pinned 13/13), with the
relay as a dumb pipe that logs everything it sees. What the probe proved:

1. B's answer is computed at A and crosses bounded (545.3 over 5 records),
   digest-verified at B, receipt chained in A's egress ledger.
2. The relay's own log contains identities, the request, authorization
   evidence and the receipt — and ZERO raw record values.
3. Refusals cross too, in words: off-whitelist op, off-policy field,
   narrow filtered cohort.
4. The privacy budget holds across the wire, survives A's restart, and
   resets honestly when the window passes.
5. A relay that doctors the answer is caught at B by digest mismatch.

What this is NOT: real transport, real machines, real encryption, real
multi-tenancy. It is the protocol proven before the infrastructure exists —
exactly the order this thesis argues for.

## Roadmap (deliberately staged)

- **Phase 0 — now (desktop seed):** the Egress Gate and capability requests on
  one machine. Every departure needs authority + receipt. *Shipped: VH 11.14.*
- **Phase 1 — two-node proof:** protocol proven in-repo (VH 11.14.3);
  next: the same messages over an encrypted laptop↔laptop channel, where
  the relay sees coordination and receipts, never payloads.
- **Phase 2 — control plane:** identity, enrollment, policy, discovery,
  session routing, audit rollup.
- **Phase 3 — org console + compliance exports:** the CISO view; GDPR
  minimization evidence as a product surface.

## What must be validated before cloud infrastructure is built

1. **Three design-partner conversations** with platform/CISO buyers: does
   "capability, not data" match a budgeted pain?
2. **Which operations** do real teams actually request across machines?
   (the whitelist is the product)
3. **Identity substrate decision:** roll our own enrollment vs ride an
   existing IdP (SSO/SAML/OIDC) — enterprises will demand the latter.
4. **Willingness to run an agent runtime (VH) as the endpoint workload** vs
   plain file/operation sharing only.

## What we are NOT claiming

- The control-plane/data-plane pattern is not novel; Tailscale and zero-trust
  architectures established it. Our bet is the *combination*: endpoint-resident
  corporate data + capability sharing + cryptographic receipts + an agent
  runtime that proves what it did.
- Model 2 does not give formal cryptographic privacy guarantees (that is
  model 3's job). It gives *data minimization by architecture*, which is what
  the regulation and the CISO actually ask for first.
- An egress gate alone is not a company. The gate is the seed; the thesis is
  the company. Validation decides which one we are building.
