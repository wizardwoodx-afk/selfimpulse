# VH 2.1 → 3.0 major upgrade

## Desktop native

v2.1 already used Tauri 2, but the window was a stock decorated frame with no tray, no menus, no multi-document tabs, and a Windows-only NSIS target.

3.0 ships a **frameless native shell**:

- Custom titlebar with macOS traffic lights / Windows caption buttons
- `data-tauri-drag-region` + `core:window:allow-start-dragging`
- Native-style File / Edit / View / Run / Help menu bar
- Document tabs (VS Code-style multi-workflow)
- Icon activity rail
- System tray with hide-on-close (native)
- Single-instance plugin — second launch focuses the existing window
- Window-state plugin — size and position persist
- Autostart-ready, notifications, dialogs, opener, process plugins
- Bundles: NSIS + DMG + AppImage + Deb
- Cross-platform keyring (Apple / Windows / Secret Service), not Windows-only

Build with `npm run tauri build`. The installer is typically 5–10 MB because Tauri uses the OS webview instead of shipping Chromium.
