/**
 * VH 11.8.5 — how the Node builtins used by `src/mission/*` reach the WebView.
 *
 * `agentsMd`, `sandbox` and `teamExecutor` import `node:fs` / `node:os` / `node:path` because the
 * probe suites run them directly under Node, and they must test the real modules — never a double.
 *
 * 11.8.1 tried to solve the browser half at runtime with `require()` inside `try {} catch {}`. That
 * was wrong twice over: `require` is not in scope in ESM, so the catch fired under Node too (the
 * probes silently tested an empty object and the gate fell to 38/40), and the empty fallback let a
 * dead filesystem masquerade as an empty workspace.
 *
 * The correct seam is the bundler, not the runtime. These three aliases apply to the browser build
 * only — the probe runner invokes esbuild directly and never reads this file, so Node keeps the
 * genuine builtins. `path` is pure string logic and gets a faithful implementation; `fs` and `os`
 * cannot exist in a WebView and get stubs that THROW with a reason, so any degradation surfaces as
 * a stated cause instead of a silent zero.
