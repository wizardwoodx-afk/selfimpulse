//! The A2A host SUPERVISOR — a persistent child, not a command with a timeout.
//!
//! WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Federation was mounted through `shell_exec`, which ends
//! in `run_timeout()`: spawn, wait, and on the deadline `child.kill()`. That is
//! exactly right for a command that finishes and exactly wrong for a server that
//! is supposed to keep listening — the A2A host would come up, print its READY
//! line, serve nothing, and be killed twenty seconds later while the UI still
//! believed it had mounted. The product shipped a button that could not work.
//!
//! So the host gets its own lifecycle, with the three states a supervisor needs:
//!
//!     start  →  starting  →  running(pid, port, card)  →  stopped
//!                          ↘  failed(words)
//!
//! Three properties this has to keep, which is why it is written out rather than
//! borrowed from the browser service (that one fires and forgets — correct for a
//! service the app always needs, wrong for one the operator mounts by hand):
//!
//!   1. `running` is a QUESTION, not a constant. Every status call asks the OS
//!      whether the child is still alive, so a host that died on its own is
//!      reported as failed instead of lingering as "running" until restart.
//!   2. Mounting is IDEMPOTENT and exclusive. One listener per app; a second
//!      start returns the existing one rather than fighting it for the port.
//!   3. The bearer token the host mints is NEVER returned to the frontend. The
//!      card, the port and the identity are operator-facing; the token is the
//!      thing a peer must present, and the UI has no business holding it.
