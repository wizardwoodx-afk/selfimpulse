/**
 * Declarative policy probe.
 *
 * The value of a policy language is entirely in its FAILURE SEMANTICS. A
 * policy engine that only works on the happy path is a config file, and a
 * config file that fails open is the bug every serious engine is built to
 * avoid. So this probe is mostly about refusal, and every semantic is asserted
 * from BOTH directions.
 *
 * The four rules, and why each exists:
 *   1. no policy permits nothing        — "we never configured it" ≠ allow
 *   2. deny before allow                — adding an allow cannot widen past a deny
 *   3. a rule that does not compile refuses — broken config is not permissive
 *   4. an evaluator that throws refuses   — a bug is a denial, not an outage
 *
 * Derived from OPA/Rego, Cedar, and the CEL-style boundary rules published with
 * agent runtimes. The code is ours; the semantics are the shared lesson.
