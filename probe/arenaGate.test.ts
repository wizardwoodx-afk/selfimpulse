/**
 * VH 11.14.7 — the Governance Arena Gate probe.
 *
 * Guardrails-as-code became guardrails-as-executable-battery in 11.14.7:
 * runGovernanceArena attacks VH's own authority machine (custody, capability,
 * egress, verifyGate, ledger) with hostile inputs and requires every boundary
 * to hold IN WORDS. This suite proves the battery runs, every scenario is
 * defended, a refusal names the reason, and the report digest is stable —
 * so a future change that weakens any boundary fails here before it ever
 * reaches a real mission.
