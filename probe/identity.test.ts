/**
 * The identity seam (src/security/identity.ts).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A GATE
 * ------------------
 * The product is local-first now and a shared server later, so the question this
 * suite answers is not "is the owner logged in" â€” nothing is â€” but:
 *
 *   1. Is there ONE source of the subject id, with no hardcoded constant left
 *      behind it? A second hardcoded `USER` would mean receipts and audit rows
 *      could be attributed to different people, which is the exact failure an
 *      audit exists to detect.
 *   2. Does a future provider drop in WITHOUT any call site changing? That is
 *     only true if the interface is the real seam, and it is pinned by installing
 *     a restricted provider and watching capabilities actually narrow.
 *   3. Does the provider FAIL CLOSED? Every dangerous direction here is fail-open:
 *     no identity granting everything, a throwing provider reporting a user, an
 *     unknown capability treated as granted, an unknown data class silently
 *     treated as "general" (the unsafe direction, because "general" skips the
 *     HIPAA rules).
 *   4. Is the POSTURE stated honestly? A build that authenticates nobody must
 *     not be able to render itself as authenticated.
