/**
 * Shell affordances — the controls and states a user must be able to see.
 *
 * These checks exist because three real defects shipped unnoticed:
 *
 *   1. THE WINDOW HAD NO CLOSE BUTTON. The desktop window is created with
 *      `decorations: false`, so the OS draws no title bar. The window API in
 *      `src/app/desktop.ts` implemented minimise / maximise / close, but no
 *      component ever rendered a control that called it. The application could
 *      only be closed with a keyboard shortcut.
 *
 *   2. THE MEMORY TOGGLE NEVER LOOKED ON. The switch CSS selected on
 *      `[aria-checked=true]`, but the control is a real `<input type=checkbox>`,
 *      which never carries that attribute. The state changed; the pixels did
 *      not.
 *
 *   3. THE CHAT COMPOSER SAT TOO HIGH. The hero had a fixed 72px top pad,
 *      which put the input in the top third of the window.
 *
 * A fourth check pins the naming rule the adoption register depends on: no
 * third-party project name may appear in product source.
