/**
 * probe/crew.test.ts — THE CREW WORKSPACE (19.7.4 [Crew]).
 *
 * Pins: creation (dynamic pool → crew ≤ 25 → all acts gated under manual),
 * the human gate (approve/refuse, honest refusals), hot-switch mid-session
 * (gated safe members open under full; the ledger names the in-flight
 * contract), the real parallel run (member receipts, BEW trails, session
 * receipt), failover from the same-domain bench (named by the steward),
 * the crew breaker (3 consecutive unresolved failures → cooled down,
 * visible), and the empty-pool refusal.
