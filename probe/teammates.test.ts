/**
 * TEAMMATES PLANE PROBE — 19.5.6 (crew UX, VH-hardened).
 *
 * Pins the crew plane mechanically:
 *   1. every multi-member run derives a Chief Steward row + one teammate row
 *      per routed specialist, each carrying REAL receipt digests;
 *   2. statuses are honest (done / gated / refused / error — never dressed up);
 *   3. the WORKSPACE line is derived from the member's actual tool surface +
 *      the run's stated workspace seam — a non-Reach member is NEVER shown a
 *      browser session, a toolless member states "no workspace";
 *   4. the coordination feed names how many agents were messaged and what
 *      each returned;
 *   5. the playground is labelled a demo;
 *   6. trace language is precise: sha256 digests are "trace digests", ECDSA
 *      P-256 lives on the authority line only — a digest is never relabelled
 *      a signature;
 *   7. the wiring is structural: the door renders the crew desk, the CSS
 *      ships, and the module states the honesty difference
 *      ("anyone can SHOW a trace; VH SIGNS it").
