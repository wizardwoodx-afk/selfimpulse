/**
 * probe/shipyard.test.ts — The Shipyard, VH's Team workspace (19.1.0).
 *
 * Pins the contract: a brief becomes work orders via the product's OWN
 * router (capped, never padded), every order is supervised by its
 * domain's Captain, orders execute only through real runs, a blocked
 * order blocks the build, DONE requires every order executed, SETTLED
 * requires the whole ship and seals a digest, and the summary never
 * claims progress that did not happen.
