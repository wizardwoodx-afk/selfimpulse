/**
 * 11Handle 16.7.0 — OFFICIAL SDK CLIENT CONFORMANCE (probe #90).
 *
 * The 16.5.0 review, item 3 (part two): the router is hand-implemented
 * (no official SDK). 16.6 pinned the WIRE against the official JSON Schemas.
 * 16.7 pins the WIRE against the official CLIENT: this suite drives the
 * REAL server (tools/mcp.mjs over real stdio) with the official
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` client library (pinned devDependency,
 * v1.30.0 — its latest protocol is 2025-11-25, which our server advertises
 * as a supported legacy revision).
 *
 * The proof this gives: a spec-faithful client implementation — written by
 * the MCP maintainers, not us — connects, negotiates, lists, calls, gates,
 * approves and verifies against our hand-implemented server. Successful
 * connection is itself the version-negotiation proof: the SDK only accepts
 * a protocol version it knows, so our server must answer its 2025-11-25
 * handshake with 2025-11-25 (echo), not the modern revision.
