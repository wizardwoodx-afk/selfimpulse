/**
 * Enforcement probes — every fix in b2c5ae0 pinned by a test that FAILS on the
 * pre-fix code. Written against the rule that a check which cannot fail is
 * worse than no check at all (the defect that produced F16 in the first place).
 *
 * §1 F16  a forged signature on the CURRENT wire format is rejected
 * §2 F17  one outcome classifier, and "gated-out" is never a success
 * §3 F5a  egress policy is applied to the URL wiki.search actually fetches
 * §4 F5b  an earned-autonomy grant must cover every routed member
 * §5 F18  the theme resolves before first paint
