/**
 * probe/securityReview.test.ts — the signed security-review artifact (16.9.5).
 *
 * 16.6.0 honestly named the signed audit report a PLANNED deliverable. This
 * probe pins the shipped artifact: it is a SELF-ASSESSMENT whose every claim
 * carries a machine-checkable evidence pointer, whose limitations are stated
 * in words, whose digest is canonical (tamper-evident), and whose signature
 * rides the SAME receipt issuer keychain — with the unsigned path honest.
