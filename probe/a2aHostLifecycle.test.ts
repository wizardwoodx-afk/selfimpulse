/**
 * probe/a2aHostLifecycle.test.ts — does the A2A host actually STAY MOUNTED?
 *
 * This suite exists because of a bug that no source-reading review would have
 * caught, and a real user would have caught in one click.
 *
 * The desktop app mounted the A2A host through `shell_exec`, which ends in
 * `run_timeout()`: spawn, wait for exit, and `child.kill()` on the deadline. An
 * A2A host is a server — it never exits on its own — so the call waited 20
 * seconds, killed the freshly-started listener, and returned a timeout. The UI
 * showed a failed mount for a process that had, in fact, started correctly and
 * been murdered by its own supervisor.
 *
 * So this suite runs the real bundled host as a real child process and asks the
 * only question that matters: after it says it is ready, is it still alive
 * twenty-plus seconds later? That is the property the new supervisor exists to
 * provide, and it is the property the old code path could not.

     *
     * On POSIX, child.kill("SIGTERM") delivers a real signal: the host's
     * process.on("SIGTERM") handler runs, it writes SI-A2A-STOPPED, and it
     * exits 0. That is the contract this suite was written to pin.
     *
     * On Windows there is no such thing as a deliverable SIGTERM. Node/libuv
     * implements child.kill("SIGTERM") as a hard TerminateProcess, so the
     * child is destroyed before any JS handler can run. Measured on this box
     * with a handler installed exactly like the host's:
     *
     *     {"code":null,"sig":"SIGTERM","handlerRan":false}
     *
     * The handler did not run, yet Node still reports the signal as "SIGTERM".
     * So on Windows the absence of SI-A2A-STOPPED is a property of the OS, not
     * of the host: the code path at tools/si-host-engine.mjs:7371-7385 is
     * correct and does run on POSIX. Asserting a Unix exit code and a Unix
     * farewell line on Windows tested the platform, not the product.
     *
     * What is NOT relaxed: the mount-liveness property in section 2 — the whole
     * reason this suite exists — is asserted identically on every platform, and
     * the strict "unmounted in words" / "clean exit" pair still runs in full
     * wherever SIGTERM is actually deliverable. */
