/**
 * egressNet probe — DNS- and IP-aware egress enforcement.
 *
 * The string policy in guardrail.test.ts stays exactly as it was. This probe
 * pins the layer that a string check structurally cannot provide, and it starts
 * with a bypass that was LIVE in the shipped code.
 *
 *   http://[::ffff:a9fe:a9fe]/ is 169.254.169.254 — the AWS/Azure/GCP metadata
 *   endpoint — written as an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. checkEgressUrl's IPv6
 *   tests match only /^(fc|fd)/ and /fe80:/, so it classified this as an
 *   ordinary public IPv6 host and allowed it. The guard existed to stop exactly
 *   this request.
 *
 * Sections:
 *   1. the mapped-IPv6 bypass is closed
 *   2. normalization (integer / octal / hex / short / zone-id forms)
 *   3. classification against the IANA special-purpose registries
 *   4. resolution — fail-closed on mixed answers, and the rebinding window
 *   5. redirects are manual, capped, and re-vetted on every hop
 *   6. loopback stays allowed for the native provider path
