/**
 * Documentation-consistency probe.
 *
 * An outside reviewer noticed three release documents disagreeing about the
 * same number — 156, 171 and 172 — and was right to. The cause is not carelessness:
 * the counts are HAND-TYPED into prose, and a probe gate legitimately changes
 * them every time a suite is added. BUILD-INFO records this biting twice already
 * (the 19.7.13 entry documents correcting a 156/155 line).
 *
 * So this probe removes the possibility rather than asking anyone to remember.
 * Any live document that states a suite count MUST state the measured one. A
 * count that cannot be verified is not allowed to ship.
 *
 * Scope: live-facing documents. `docs/history/` is a release log and is exempt by
 * design — a historical entry that says 156 was true when written. Likewise the
 * hand-authored narrative inside BUILD-INFO, which the generated gate line above
 * it already pins (probe/offlinePack).
