/**
 * probe/scoreSourceOfTruth.test.ts — ONE metric, ONE source of truth (17.10.3).
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS
 *
 * 17.10.0 fixed `harborRerate()`, which returned `60 + seats * 3` — assurance that
 * rose every time you added an agent. Its tests passed. Its release notes said the
 * fabricated number was fixed.
 *
 * It wasn't. A SECOND implementation survived in `src/app/harbor.tsx`:
 *
 *     assuranceScore: Math.min(96, 60 + s.receipts.length * 2 + s.skills.length * 3)
 *
 * ...and it was rendered by TWO live surfaces (Harbor "Safe harbor", Register
 * "Assurance score"). The authoritative scorer had been fixed; a parallel
 * presentation path still invented a number. The new module's tests could not
 * see it, because the defect was never in that module.
 *
 * THE LESSON, MADE MECHANICAL
 *
 * A "security fixed" release must not pass on the strength of the new module's
 * tests alone. When you fix a concept, you have to search the whole live
 * runtime for every OTHER implementation of that concept. That is a grep, and a
 * grep belongs in the gate — not in a reviewer's memory.
 *
 * This suite therefore pins the CONCEPT, not the function:
 *   1. a numeric assurance may be produced in exactly ONE place
 *   2. no surface may synthesise one from literals
 *   3. every surface renders through the one shared formatter
