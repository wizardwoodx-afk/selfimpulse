 * probe · cleanNaming — the SHIPPED TREE carries clean SelfImpulse naming.
 *
 * Repo-wide gate (the review finding made permanent): current surfaces —
 * product code, legal, installer metadata, config, docs, probes, tools — carry
 * no retired predecessor spellings and no outside-product names.
 *
 * Named exceptions (each does real work and is documented):
 *   - docs/history/**            the historical ledger by design.
 *   - protocol/src/core/si-crypto.js  HKDF info labels (pre-rename wire labels)
 *                                are baked into issued wrapped keys — renaming
 *                                would break issued data (docs/LEGACY-COMPAT.md).
 *   - probe/fixtures/**          signed wire fixtures — byte-stable by contract.
 *   - legacy wire/shim tokens    (proof-receipt formats, db filename, keychain
 *                                service names, control-mcp aliases, …) live by
 *                                the allowlist + docs contract of probe/legacyCompat.
 *   - verify/suites|specs        generated bundles (rebuilt from these sources).
