/**
 * probe/pairing.test.ts — peer pairing, bind scope, and a clean stop.
 *
 * Three findings from the release review live here, because they are one story:
 * a desktop-mounted A2A host could not be reached by a peer, could not safely be
 * given a credential, and was killed rather than asked to stop.
 *
 *   LOCAL-ONLY. The host defaults to 127.0.0.1 and the supervisor passed no bind
 *   address at all, so the Federation screen's promise to "let other nodes
 *   delegate work to this one" was true only for this machine. The fix is an
 *   explicit scope chosen before the mount — never a wildcard.
 *
 *   NO CREDENTIAL ROUTE. The supervisor rightly never returns the host's bearer
 *   token, and that left remote federation impossible: the credential existed
 *   and no honest path to it did. Pairing is that path — a one-time code the
 *   operator reads out, which mints a credential scoped to one peer.
 *
 *   FORCEFUL STOP. `kill()` worked, but the host has a SIGTERM handler that
 *   closes its own listener. Unmounting should use the path the host provides.
