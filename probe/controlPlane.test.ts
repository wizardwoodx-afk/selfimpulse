/**
 * Control-plane probe (V11, W2).
 *
 * The V5 stub advertised 8 tools and implemented 1 — an echo that answered `ok: true`. V7 made
 * the lie impossible (unimplemented tools refuse). V11 closes the loop: advertisement equals
 * behavior. Since the dispatcher is Rust and this environment has no cargo, this probe pins
 * the SOURCE-LEVEL invariants the same way `wiring.test.ts` does — the parseable contract that
 * `cargo test` (control_mcp's own unit tests, which ship in the file) double-checks natively.
 *
 * Run: ./node_modules/.bin/esbuild probe/controlPlane.test.ts --bundle --platform=node --format=esm \
 *        --outfile=/tmp/cplane.mjs --log-level=error && node /tmp/cplane.mjs
