/**
 * probe/decisionReceipt.test.ts — 11h-decision/1.
 *
 * What is being pinned here is a posture, not a format: a REFUSAL is the
 * decision this product most needs to be able to defend. An allow is implied by
 * the run continuing, so it barely needs recording. A deny is the exact place a
 * fail-open bug would live, and the evidence system has to survive someone
 * editing the log afterwards.
 *
 * So the load-bearing assertions are the hostile ones: flip a deny to an allow,
 * rename the rule that refused, widen the grant, replay against different
 * evidence, and add a field after signing. Each of those must fail loudly, and
 * each must SAY why.
