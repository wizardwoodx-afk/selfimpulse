 * screen renders. A bad lookup or a `.map` over `undefined` type-checks perfectly
 * and then blanks the screen behind an error boundary. So this renders the REAL
 * shell and every door through `react-dom/server` and asserts on the output —
 * with no localStorage, no WebGL, no provider: the coldest first run there is.
