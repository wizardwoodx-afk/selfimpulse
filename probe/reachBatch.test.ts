/**
 * probe/reachBatch.test.ts — the 200-specialist federation batch.
 *
 * The batch is a generated snapshot of a reviewed spec: forty industry
 * domains, each staffed at five stations of work. This suite is its drift
 * gate AND its honesty gate — the batch must equal its spec, must not collide
 * with a single id the fleet already owns, and must not have quietly joined
 * the registry behind the owner's back.
 *
 *   §1 the snapshot is the spec — regenerate and it must be byte-identical
 *   §2 40 × 5, with the census the spec promises
 *   §3 disjoint from all four existing benches — an additive batch, not a hijack
 *   §4 every entry is a real entry: capabilities, vocabulary, prompt, tier
 *   §5 additive means additive: the registry's own numbers do not move
