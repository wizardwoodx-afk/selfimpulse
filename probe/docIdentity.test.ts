/**
 * probe/docIdentity.test.ts — exhaustive release-document identity scanning (16.9.5).
 *
 * The 16.9.1 external review found the last identity-drift class: current-facing
 * documents (one-pager, deck outline, platform limits) still naming an old release
 * while every manifest said the new one. versionDrift pins the manifests; this suite
 * pins the DOCS:
 *
 *   current docs  →  scan every release-string occurrence
 *                 →  allow historical references only (named patterns)
 *                 →  anything else that is not PRODUCT_VERSION  →  FAIL
 *
 * Scope: every Markdown file at the repo root and under docs/ — except CHANGELOG.md
 * (the historical changelog).
 * Matches both "16.9.5" and "v16.9.5" forms, and bare minor forms ("16.9").

/* 19.7.10 [Screenwright] — THE DORMANT GATE, REPAIRED.

   The sixth external review found this suite had gone VACUOUS: VERSION_RE and
   HISTORICAL were both hardcoded to major `16`, written when 16.x was current.
   From the first 19.x release onward the regex matched NO string in any
   document, so `offenders` was always empty and the suite reported green while
   scanning nothing. That is the worst failure mode a drift gate can have — it
   looks like assurance and is the absence of it.

   The patterns are now DERIVED FROM THE RELEASE IDENTITY, so they track every
   future major instead of silently disarming at the next one. A regression
   check below pins that the regex still matches the current major. */

     • without the lookahead the optional patch group backtracks, so
       "a retired-name 19.7.9 installer artifact" also yielded a bare "19.7";
     • with only ONE optional group, "19.7.10.1" backtracked to "19.7.1" —
       the patch digit matched the "1" of "10" and the lookahead then passed
       on the following "0".
   So: up to three numeric groups after the major, and a lookahead that
   refuses BOTH a following ".<digit>" and a bare following digit. */
