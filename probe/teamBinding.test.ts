/**
 * V9 — team binding, end to end.
 *
 * `agentTeam.test.ts` proves the team model in isolation. This proves the other half: that a saved
 * crew actually changes what a real MissionRuntime plans. A team that only lives in the Teams page
 * would be decoration, and VH does not ship decoration.
 *
 * Planning here is real. Execution is not run — nothing in this test needs a CLI.
