/**
 * probe/executivePanels.test.ts — the three unifying planes (16.9.1).
 *
 * The 16.9.0 external review found the gap: the underlying engines
 * (assuranceScore, finOps, evidencePack, receiptVault) are each probe-pinned,
 * but the COMPOSITION layer — the executive panels that render them — was not.
 * This probe pins the composition contract:
 *
 *   TrustCenterPanel         (Proof door)   — unifies vault + issuer + crosswalk + assurance;
 *                                             exports a Trust Pack naming the crosswalk and the
 *                                             zero-install verifier.
 *   AssuranceScorecardPanel  (Audit door)   — the 0–100 measured-only score, honestly badged.
 *   CostPerOutcomePanel      (Audit door)   — measured chargeback; `unmeasured` stays unmeasured.
 *
 * Ethos pins: real engines (not reinvented math), the labeled-demo disclosure,
 * token-only styling (no hardcoded palette hex outside the theme system), and
 * both doors actually render the panels.
